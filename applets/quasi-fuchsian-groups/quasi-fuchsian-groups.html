	<meta property="og:description" content="Popularized in the book Indra&#x2019;s Pearls, quasi-Fuchsian groups are discrete groups of conformal (i.e. angle-preserving) transformations of the complex numbers &mdash; but only ones where the limit set is contained in a Jordan curve. A more down-to-earth explanation is that a quasi-Fuchsian group contains a handful of functions, and applying those functions and their inverses repeatedly can make a given starting point converge somewhere. If we plot all of those somewheres, we often end up with a striking picture &mdash; even the simplest case is an Apollonian net, a fractal created by filling a large circle with smaller ones."/>
