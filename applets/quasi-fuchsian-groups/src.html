# Quasi-Fuchsian Groups

Popularized in the book <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_Pearls_(book)">Indra's Pearls</a>, quasi-Fuchsian groups are discrete groups of conformal (i.e. angle-preserving) transformations of the complex numbers --- but only ones where the limit set is contained in a Jordan curve. A more down-to-earth explanation is that a quasi-Fuchsian group contains a handful of functions, and applying those functions and their inverses repeatedly can make a given starting point converge somewhere. If we plot all of those somewheres, we often end up with a striking picture --- even the simplest case is an Apollonian net, a fractal created by filling a large circle with smaller ones.

## High Resolution Capture

A note: high resolutions can lead to somewhat disappointing results, since the limit set is always about a single pixel thick. To produce a brighter image without losing too much quality, apply one or two passes of <a href="https://www.gimp.org">GIMP's</a> dialate filter.
