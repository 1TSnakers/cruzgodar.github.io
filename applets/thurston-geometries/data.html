The first three effectively state that lines, line segments, and circles can be constructed, and the fourth that all right angles are equal, but the fifth, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate">parallel postulate</a>, is subtler: a concise equivalent statement is that the angles of any triangle add up to <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span>. After remaining unproven from the other four for centuries (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate#History">though not for lack of effort</a>), mathematicians came to accept that not only was it necessary to take as an axiom, but that it could be replaced with similar statements to produce consistent &mdash; but quite alien &mdash; theories of geometry. If we require the angles of a triangle to sum to more than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span>, the result is <em>spherical</em> geometry. Try it yourself by drawing an equilateral triangle on a globe with its base on the equator and a vertex at the north pole: all of its angles are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="90^\circ">$90^\circ$</span>. Insisting that the angles of a triangle sum to less than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span> results in <em>hyperbolic</em> geometry, in which a seemingly impossible amount of area is crammed into a two-dimensional surface. These two geometries, along with the geometry of the flat plane, now called <em>euclidean</em>, are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem">only three</a> possible on a curved 2-dimensional surface (called a <em>2-manifold</em>) without holes.</p><p class="body-text">Stated in 1982 and first proven in the early 2000s, William Thurston&#x2019;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture">geometrization conjecture</a> classifies the geometries of <em>3-manifolds</em> that have no holes and cannot be decomposed into other 3-manifolds, producing what amounts to a periodic table of geometries. There are eight in total, but all except our own are curved in higher dimensions, preventing us from understanding them from an outside perspective like we can with the 2-dimensional geometries. Instead, we can understand them from <em>within</em>, rendering scenes with light traveling along the paths of shortest distance. The results are in turns beautiful, mesmerizing, and unsettling, and quite often all three at once. Rather than describe the process further, the first geometry in the dropdown (<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>) demonstrates the details of the process on the sphere, rendering a 1D image. Drag on the scene to look around, and <span style="display: inline" id="controls-text-touch">hold with two fingers to move forward and three to move backward.</span><span style="display: inline" id="controls-text-wasd">use the WASD, shift, and space keys to move and Q and E to roll the camera.</span></p><p class="body-text">As always, this applet was made with <a href="/projects/wilson/">Wilson</a>.

The top canvas shows the sphere, called <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>, with the white dot indicating the location of the camera. The bottom canvas is the 1-dimensional image that it sees &mdash; drag left and right on it to look around. The rays emanating from the camera demonstrate how that image is formed: light travels from the colored dots to the camera along paths of shortest distance, called <em>geodesics</em>, which here are circular arcs. For simplicity, we usually think of looking out from the camera along geodesics until we reach an object. Sometimes, the paths don&#x2019;t hit anything and wrap all the way around, in which case we color them black (the camera itself isn&#x2019;t rendered).</p><p class="body-text">A peculiar aspect of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> geometry is that objects opposite the camera&#x2019;s position, like the purple dot at the bottom of the sphere when the camera is on top, are reached by <em>every</em> geodesic that isn&#x2019;t stopped by an earlier object &mdash; that&#x2019;s why we can see the purple dot in our entire field of view behind all the others. In general, objects on the opposite hemisphere as the camera look <em>larger</em> the farther away from them we get, resulting in a bizarre sort of depth perception.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="e3-text"><p class="body-text">Our first geometry is hopefully pretty familiar: it&#x2019;s the one we live in! In this notation, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> stands for euclidean, so <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> means that the geometry is euclidean in all directions. The geodesics (the paths of shortest distance that light necessarily travels along) are straight lines, and so everything should look roughly normal. This geometry serves mostly as a control for what to expect in the others: the rooms are cubes with spherical holes cored out of them, and generally are better at demonstrating the local structure of the space, while the spheres are better at demonstrating the global structure.</p><p class="body-text"><span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> is an <em>isotropic</em> geometry, which means that it looks the same in every direction. This is something that&#x2019;s easy to take for granted: there&#x2019;s no up or down without gravity, but that&#x2019;s only the case because our universe is isotropic. As we&#x2019;ll see in the later geometries, moving in different directions can have fundamentally different results.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="s3-text"><p class="body-text">Our opening example used the <em>2-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>, and the superscript <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span> implies there should be other spheres with different dimensions. The awkwardly-named <em>1-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^1">$S^1$</span> is just a circle (i.e. the points in 2-dimensional space that are distance <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$</span> from the origin), and importantly for us, the <em>3-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is the corresponding construction in 4-dimensional space. Although we use the term &#x201C;sphere&#x201D;, it&#x2019;s as poor a descriptor for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> as it is for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^1">$S^1$</span>: <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is a 3-manifold, so it has volume &mdash; we can move around inside of it.</p><p class="body-text">The geodesics are great circles, exactly like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>, so we see the same effects of faraway objects appearing large and even filling our entire field of view. We can fit 8 cubical rooms into <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> in the same way that we can cover <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> in 6 squares by inflating a cube into a spherical shape, and in fact, this is the only geometry in the list with finitely many rooms or spheres inside it. That&#x2019;s for good reason: it&#x2019;s guaranteed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_conjecture">Poincare&#769; conjecture</a>.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="h3-text"><p class="body-text">The last of the isotropic geometries, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^3">$\mathbb{H}^3$</span> is 3-dimensional <em>hyperbolic</em> space. One simple comparison between these first three geometries is to count the number of cubical rooms that fit around a corner by making the wall thickness negative and looking down from above on one of the pointy corners left over. In <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span>, there are (of course) four rooms, but in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span>, there are only three, and in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^3">$\mathbb{H}^3$</span>, there are more than four &mdash; in this model, there are six.</p><p class="body-text">The geodesics are hyperbolas, so they eventually become close to being straight lines. However, the speed at which they necessarily have to travel makes the effect of moving forward look qualitatively different from moving in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> &mdash; it&#x2019;s more akin to zooming in on a picture, and it can feel like the camera is constantly about to crash into a wall. The same goes for moving left and right or up and down: distant rooms look like paintings on a wall instead of spaces with depth.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="s2xe-text"><p class="body-text">The three geometries on simply connected 2-manifolds are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^2">$\mathbb{E}^2$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>, and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2">$\mathbb{H}^2$</span>, and we&#x2019;ve just seen their direct 3-manifold analogues. If we&#x2019;re trying to produce all 8 geometries, the next-easiest thing to try is taking products of smaller geometries. There&#x2019;s only one possible geometry on a simply connected 1-manifold &mdash; <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> &mdash; and sticking three copies of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> orthogonally together produces <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} = \mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} = \mathbb{E}^3$</span>, which we&#x2019;ve already dealt with, so we&#x2019;ll need to use a 2-dimensional geometry. We can&#x2019;t use <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^2 \times \mathbb{E}^1">$\mathbb{E}^2 \times \mathbb{E}^1$</span> since that&#x2019;s just <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> again, but the other two produce <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$S^2 \times \mathbb{E}$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}$</span>: two new geometries.</p><p class="body-text">Here, the factor of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> is the vertical axis, so moving only up and down looks like euclidean space. Similarly, moving only laterally looks like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> (or the intro <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> scene). The effect of antipodal objects filling the entire field of vision in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is somehow made even stranger as antipodal spheres fill our view laterally, but we can also look down on them from above.</p></div></section></main>
