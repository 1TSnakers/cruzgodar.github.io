The first three effectively state that lines, line segments, and circles can be constructed, and the fourth that all right angles are equal, but the fifth, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate">parallel postulate</a>, is subtler: a concise equivalent statement is that the angles of any triangle add up to <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span>. After remaining unproven from the other four for centuries (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate#History">though not for lack of effort</a>), mathematicians came to accept that not only was it necessary to take as an axiom, but that it could be replaced with similar statements to produce consistent &mdash; but quite alien &mdash; theories of geometry. If we require the angles of a triangle to sum to more than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span>, the result is <em>spherical</em> geometry. Try it yourself by drawing an equilateral triangle on a globe with its base on the equator and a vertex at the north pole: all of its angles are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="90^\circ">$90^\circ$</span>. Insisting that the angles of a triangle sum to less than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span> results in <em>hyperbolic</em> geometry, in which a seemingly impossible amount of area is crammed into a two-dimensional surface. These two geometries, along with the geometry of the flat plane, now called <em>euclidean</em>, are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem">only three</a> possible on a curved 2-dimensional surface (called a <em>2-manifold</em>) without holes.</p><p class="body-text">Stated in 1982 and first proven in the early 2000s, William Thurston&#x2019;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture">geometrization conjecture</a> classifies the geometries of <em>3-manifolds</em> that have no holes and cannot be decomposed into other 3-manifolds, giving what amounts to a periodic table of geometries. There are eight in total, but all but our own are curved in higher dimensions, preventing us from understanding them from an outside perspective like we can with the 2-dimensional geometries. Instead, we can understand them from <em>within</em>, rendering scenes with light traveling along the paths of shortest distance. The results are in turns beautiful, mesmerizing, and unsettling, and quite often all three at once. Rather than describe the process further, the first scene demonstrates the details of the process on the sphere, rendering a 1D image. Drag on the scene to look around, and <span style="display: inline" id="controls-text-touch">hold with two fingers to move forward and three to move backward.</span><span style="display: inline" id="controls-text-wasd">use the WASD, Shift, and Space keys to move and Q and E to roll the camera.</span></p><p class="body-text">As always, this applet was made with <a href="/projects/wilson/">Wilson</a>.

The top canvas shows the sphere, called <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span>, with the white dot indicating the location of the camera. The bottom canvas is the 1-dimensional image that it sees &mdash; drag left and right on it to look around. The rays emanating from the camera demonstrate how that image is formed: light travels from the colored dots to the camera along paths of shortest distance, called <em>geodesics</em>, which here are circular arcs. For simplicity, we usually think of looking out from the camera along geodesics until we reach an object. Sometimes, the paths don&#x2019;t hit anything and wrap all the way around, in which case we color them black (the camera itself isn&#x2019;t rendered).</p><p class="body-text">A peculiar aspect of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> geometry is that objects opposite the camera&#x2019;s position, like the purple dot at the bottom of the sphere when the camera is on top, are reached by <em>every</em> geodesic that isn&#x2019;t stopped by an earlier object &mdash; that&#x2019;s why we can see the purple dot in our entire field of view behind all the others. In general, objects on the opposite hemisphere as the camera look <em>larger</em> the farther away from them we get, resulting in a bizarre sort of depth perception.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="e3-rooms-text"><p class="body-text">Our first geometry is hopefully familiar: it&#x2019;s the one we live in.</p></div><div id="canvas-landscape"><div id="canvas-landscape-left"><div class='text-boxes'><div class="text-box-container"><input id="resolution-input" class="text-box" type="text" value="500" tabindex="1"><p class="body-text text-box-subtext">Resolution</p></div></div><div class='sliders'><div class="slider-container"><input id="test-slider" type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0" step="0.000001" data-precision="3" data-logarithmic="0" data-int="0" tabindex="1"><label for="test-slider"><p class="body-text slider-subtext">test: <span id="test-slider-value">0.000</span></p></label></div><div class="slider-container"><input id="wall-thickness-slider" type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0" step="0.000001" data-precision="3" data-logarithmic="0" data-int="0" tabindex="1"><label for="wall-thickness-slider"><p class="body-text slider-subtext">Wall Thickness: <span id="wall-thickness-slider-value">0.000</span></p></label></div><div class="slider-container"><input id="fiber-thickness-slider" type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0" step="0.000001" data-precision="3" data-logarithmic="0" data-int="0" tabindex="1"><label for="fiber-thickness-slider"><p class="body-text slider-subtext">Fiber Thickness: <span id="fiber-thickness-slider-value">0.000</span></p></label></div><div class="slider-container"><input id="fov-slider" type="range" min="80" max="120" value="100" step="0.000001" data-precision="2" data-logarithmic="0" data-int="0" tabindex="1"><label for="fov-slider"><p class="body-text slider-subtext">FOV: <span id="fov-slider-value">100.00</span></p></label></div></div><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button" type="button" id="switch-scene-button" tabindex="-1">Switch Scene</button></div></div></div><div id="canvas-landscape-middle"><div id="output-canvas-container"><canvas id='output-canvas' class='output-canvas'></canvas></div><div id="demo-canvas-container" style="display: none"><canvas id="demo-canvas" class="output-canvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas></div></div><div id="canvas-landscape-right"><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button" type="button" id="download-button" tabindex="-1">Download</button></div></div></div></div></section></main>
