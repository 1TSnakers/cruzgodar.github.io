	How do you sort a long list of numbers? Or, more accurately, how do you instruct a computer to? This has been a compelling question from as early as the 1950s, and dozens upon dozens of algorithms have been created, each with pros and cons. These days, high-level programming languages mostly abstract this away &mdash; in JavaScript, it&#x2019;s as easy as calling <code>array.sort()</code>, and no thought needs to be given to how best to actually do the sorting. This is a very good thing for the most part, but it&#x2019;s interesting &mdash; and often mesmerizing &mdash; to watch specific sorting algorithms work, so I&#x2019;ve implemented ten very different ones. Here, the object to be sorted is a color wheel &mdash; presing the Sort button first shuffles it, then sorts it with the method of choice, and then verifies that it has been correctly sorted.
	
	Every algorithm is explained in more detail below, but there are a few general things to mention beforehand. When comparing the speed of algorithms, we need a measurement of time that doesn&#x2019;t depend on the power of the computer running it. Because of this, we typically don&#x2019;t use actual time units, like seconds, but instead something called <dfn>big-O notation</dfn>. If a sorting algorithm is $O(n^3)$, then the time it takes to run increases with the square of the amount of data given to it. We may not know how long it will take to sort a list of $500$ elements, but it will take about $8$ times as long to sort a list of $1000$ elements. An algorithm that&#x2019;s $O(n)$, on the other hand, will only take about twice as long.
	
	Whenever a sorting algorithm modifies the list, that location in the color wheel (i.e. a thin band) is highlighted, and if it&#x2019;s enabled, a sound is played with pitch based on the number written. All of the algorithms are normalized to take about 20 seconds to complete, regardless of how fast they actually take, so to compare them, look at the number of reads and writes.
