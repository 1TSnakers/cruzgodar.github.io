!header The Chaos Game



!text b j Draw a pentagon and a single dot in the center. Now roll a five-sided die to randomly pick one of the vertices of the pentagon and draw a new dot halfway between the first dot and that vertex. Roll the die again, draw a dot halfway between that one and the new vertex, and repeat. If you have a few hundred years on hand, you&#x2019;ll have a very interesting picture. Depending on the inital polygon drawn, we can get some wild results &mdash; see if you recognize the triangle version, for example. Like <a href="/applets/the-barnsley-fern/the-barnsley-fern.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/the-barnsley-fern/the-barnsley-fern.html')">the Barnsley Fern</a> and <a href="/applets/the-kicked-rotator/the-kicked-rotator.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/the-kicked-rotator/the-kicked-rotator.html')">the Kicked Rotator</a>, this process, often called the Chaos Game, is an example of an iterated function system, where we repeatedly apply a given function. It differs from examples like the <a href="/applets/julia-set-explorer/julia-set-explorer.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/julia-set-explorer/julia-set-explorer.html')">Mandelbrot set</a>, though, in that we&#x2019;re tracking the movement of one point over time rather than iterating every point individually.
