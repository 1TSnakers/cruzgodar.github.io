	<meta property="og:description" content="A perfect matching on a graph is a pairing of adjacent vertices so that every vertex is paired with exactly one other. On a square lattice, this amounts to filling a shape with 2 x 1 dominos so that no gaps are left. Here, that shape is the Aztec Diamond, a collection of squares that form a ragged-edged diamond. Choosing a (uniformly) random tiling by dominos seems like a difficult task, but we can actually build one up from tilings of smaller diamonds, one step at a time. Dominos are colored by their starting location, and more saturated the longer they stay on screen."/>

	A <dfn>perfect matching</dfn> on a graph is a pairing of adjacent vertices so that every vertex is paired with exactly one other. On a square lattice, this amounts to filling a shape with $2 \times 1$ dominos so that no gaps are left. Here, that shape is the <dfn>Aztec Diamond</dfn>, a collection of squares that form a ragged-edged diamond. Choosing a (uniformly) random tiling by dominos seems like a difficult task, but we can actually build one up from tilings of smaller diamonds, one step at a time. Dominos are colored by their starting location, and more saturated the longer they stay on screen.
