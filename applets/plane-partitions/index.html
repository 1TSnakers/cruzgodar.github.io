I&#x2019;m proud of the result, though: this applet visualizes <strong>plane partitions</strong>, which are stacks of boxes with one restriction: the height doesn&#x2019;t increase when moving down or to the right. The resulting objects can be viewed in 2D or 3D &mdash; the 3D view looks like a bunch of rhombi, and drawing a line in the center (called a <strong>dimer</strong>) produces a one-to-one correspondence between plane partitions and what are called <strong>perfect matchings</strong> on a hexagonal lattice, where every node is paired with exactly one other.</p><p class="body-text">Plane partitions can be made <strong>asymptotic</strong> to a shape. When adding or editing an array, replace a number with a caret (<code>^</code>) to give that square infinite height, represented with slightly lighter boxes. You can also add the symbols <code>&gt;</code> and <code>v</code> to the right and bottom margins, respectively, to create 3-leg APPs. For example, &#x201C;<code>7 ></code>&#x201D; at the end of the first line means the row of height 7 should continue forever, indicated by the same lighter boxes.</p><p class="body-text">Plane partitions are frequently studied, and many correspondences involving them have been implemented here. The first three take a plane partition and convert it to a <strong>tableau</strong> of the same shape &mdash; a tableau is a collection of numbers with no restriction on box heights decreasing in any direction. The inverse algorithms take a tableau and convert it back to a plane partition. Pak and Sulzgruber are independently discovered correspondences with wildly different descriptions that amazingly produce the same results, while Hillman-Grassl is a unique correspondence all its own. RSK is something else entirely: it takes two semi-standard Young tableaux, or SSYT, and converts them to a regular tableau. An SSYT is similar to a plane partition, but rather than heights needing to decrease along rows and columns, they must <em>increase</em>, and the increasing that happens on columns must be strict (i.e. the heights always increase and never remain the same).</p><p class="body-text">Due to the complexity of the algorithms and the difficulty in getting them to work for those unused to plane partitions, applets like this, or both, I&#x2019;ve included a few examples in the final section so that pretty pictures are easy to find without too much tinkering.</p><div id="canvas-landscape"><div id="canvas-landscape-left"><div class="text-buttons"><div class="dropdown-container focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button dropdown" type="button" id="category-selector-dropdown-button" tabindex="-1">View Controls</button><select id="category-selector-dropdown"><option value="view-controls">View Controls</option><option value="add-array">Add Array</option><option value="edit-array">Edit Array</option><option value="remove-array">Remove Array</option><option value="algorithms">Algorithms</option><option value="examples">Examples</option></select></div></div></div><div id="canvas-landscape-middle"><div style="position: relative; margin: 0 auto; width: 100
