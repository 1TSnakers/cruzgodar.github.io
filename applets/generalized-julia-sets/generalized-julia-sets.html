	This one&#x2019;s been a long time coming. The first applet I ever made for the site was a <a href="/applets/julia-set-explorer/julia-set-explorer.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/julia-set-explorer/julia-set-explorer.html')">Julia set explorer</a>, and although it took me months to learn how to optimize it to a reasonable speed, even the first version was a huge step forward in the kind of fractal generating code I&#x2019;d written up to that point. It wasn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;d made the applet for, but it was fun to mess with the code behind the scenes and make Julia sets from different generating functions. I thought about making new applets out of some of them, but it was never worth copying all the code over just for a slight variation on a theme. What I needed was an applet that allowed for near-complete control over its own code &mdash; and so here we are at last.
	
	The large text box contains the function that&#x2019;s iterated to create the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It&#x2019;s written with a proper complex number library, which means the performance is slightly worse than the original Julia set explorer applet, but the tradeoff&#x2019;s worth it. The other boxes are for parameters that modify the output &mdash; how much of the set can be seen and how far away from zero a number has to get before the applet decides it&#x2019;s never going to come back down.
	
	This is far from the most user-friendly applet, but hopefully you can get something out of it. Here are some functions to get started &mdash; see if you can find some interesting ones yourself!
