	<meta property="og:description" content="The Mandelbrot set and Julia sets share a close relationship: the Julia set with parameter c &#x201C;looks like&#x201D; the Mandelbrot set at z = c. But just how close is that resemblance? Something we might try is picking a bunch of points in the complex plane and drawing a small Julia set at every one. We&#x2019;d expect to get something vaguely resembling the Mandelbrot set &mdash; but it&#x2019;s remarkable just how accurate that picture is."/>

	The Butterfly Effect is behind many of the phenomena we think of as &#x201C;random&#x201D; &mdash; sitations as diverse as <a href="/applets/strange-attractors/strange-attractors.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/strange-attractors/strange-attractors.html')">atmospheric conditions</a> and <a href="/applets/the-kicked-rotator/the-kicked-rotator.html" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('/applets/the-kicked-rotator/the-kicked-rotator.html')">pendulums in anti-gravity chambers</a> both exhibit chaos. Here, we&#x2019;ll do something similar to the second example, but rather than modifying a pendulum with gravity, we&#x2019;ll attach another pendulum to the end of it. This is known as a <dfn>double pendulum</dfn>, fittingly enough, and it&#x2019;s famous for being a chaotic system &mdash; two nearly-identical starting positions will eventually diverge from one another. Since the starting position is determined only by the two pendulums&#x2019; angles, we can plot every possible starting position on a grid and release all of them at once. Points near the center diverge from each other more slowly, since the pendulums they correspond to are nearly straight and don&#x2019;t move much, while points near the edge have much more momentum and diverge rapidly. To pause the fractal&#x2019;s progression and view the pendulum corresponding to a single point, hit the button and hover or drag on the canvas.
