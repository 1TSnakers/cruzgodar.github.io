!text b j Have you ever looked at a fern up close? The tiny leaves are exactly the same shape as the big ones. This is a textbook example of a fractal, and while a fern may seem firmly rooted in the physical world, it&#x2019;s just as naturally a product of math. Placing a tiny green dot on a canvas, repeatedly applying a simple kind of function (called an affine transformation) to it, and drawing a new dot in every place it visits, we wind up with the Barnsley fern, named after its creator. The function we apply may have been carefully engineered, but it&#x2019;s no less remarkable that something so beautiful and complex can arise from something so simple.
