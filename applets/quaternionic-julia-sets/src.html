The <a href="/applets/julia-set-explorer/">Mandelbrot and Julia sets</a> are defined using the complex numbers, a 2D number system that lends itself to making images. It's natural to ask if there's a 3D Mandelbrot set, but unfortunately there isn't any functional 3-dimensional number system analogous to the complex numbers, and the best we have is the <a href="/applets/the-mandelbulb/">Mandelbulb</a>. If we go up one more dimension, though, we find a 4D number system --- the **quaternions** --- that behaves like the complex numbers. While we can't render four dimensions at once, we can just take a 3D slice, similar to a 2D cross-section of a 3D object. The resulting objects may not be quite as remarkable as Juliabulbs, but the underlying Julia sets are visible within them, and they have their own unique sort of beauty.

The controls are the same as in the Mandelbulb applet. While changing $c$, use the E and Q keys on a keyboard to raise and lower the height of the slice, denoted as $c_w$.
