It depends on a single parameter r that corresponds to the growth rate of the population when it&#x2019;s not near the enironment&#x2019;s capacity. If we instead flip r between two different values, we get something quite a bit more complicated, called a Lyapunov fractal. Here, every point with x and y coordinates between 0 and 4 (the same range that the standard logistic map can accept) cooresponds to a pair of values for r. The manner in which we flip between those two values depends on the generating string &mdash; for example, a string of ABBAB will use x for the first iteration, y for the second and third, x for the fourth, and then y for the fifth, before repeating this pattern indefinitely. This means that for any string, the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right matches the logistic map. The color is chosen so that the red and green channels reflect the degree to which the point is influenced by x and y, respectively, and the blue component is derived from the stability of the solution overall &mdash; regions with little or no blue tend to be closer to chaos.
