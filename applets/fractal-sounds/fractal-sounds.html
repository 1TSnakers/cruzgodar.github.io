	Half the reason I made the <a href="/applets/sorting-algorithms/sorting-algorithms.html">sorting algorithms applet</a> was to get practice using the WebAudio API so that I could make this. Iteration-based fractals like the Mandelbrot set are generated by iterating points over and over, and seeing if the path they take remains bounded or not. Some bounded points converge to a single value, but others get trapped in loops, repeating the same values over and over. For those, we can convert the $x$- and $y$-coordinates into the left and right channels of an audio track by interpolating them into sine waves. If everything is managed just right, we have a way to create sounds from fractals. This idea comes directly from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ">CodeParade</a>, who wrote this as a native application &mdash; while the WebAudio API is limited in when sounds can be played, I think there&#x2019;s something to be gained in a web-based implementation.
	
	The colors roughly indicate the fundamental frequencies of each point. Hover or drag to see the orbit of a single point, and click or tap to play the sound. On a touchscreen, use two fingers to pan and zoom.
