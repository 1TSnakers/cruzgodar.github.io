	<meta property="og:description" content="How do you sort a long list of numbers? Or, more accurately, how do you instruct a computer to? This question has compelled computer scientists from as early as the 1950s, and dozens upon dozens of algorithms have been created, each with pros and cons. These days, high-level programming languages mostly abstract this away &mdash; in JavaScript, it's as easy as calling array.sort(), and no thought needs to be given to how the sorting should actually be done. This is a very good thing for the most part, but it's interesting -- and often mesmerizing -- to watch particular sorting algorithms do their job, so for this applet, I've implemented ten very different ones. The list to be sorted is represented as a color wheel -- presing the Sort button first shuffles it, then sorts it with the method of choice, and then verifies that it has been correctly sorted."/>
