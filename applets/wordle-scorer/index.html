	<meta property="og:description" content="Though it might be dated in a year or two, I couldn&#x2019;t resist making this applet. First, a little background: Wordle accepts about 13000 5-letter words as guesses, but only draws its solutions from a curated list of about 2000 of those. Uncommon and non-standard words, along with plurals, are generally never chosen as solutions. Hardmode can be enabled before starting a round, and restricts guesses to ones matching all previous clues. We can score a guess based on how many times it halves the set of possible solutions: a score of 1 means there are half as many as before, while a score of 5 means the set has been halved five times, resulting in 32 times fewer solutions. Since there are close to 2048 = 2^11 solutions initially, a total score of about 11 is necessary to narrow it down to a single word. This assumes perfect knowledge of which words can appear as solutions, though, so in practice it usually takes more. Importantly, the score does not consider the actual solution."/>

	Though it might be dated in a year or two, I couldn&#x2019;t resist making this applet. First, a little background: <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> accepts about 13000 5-letter words as guesses, but only draws its solutions from a curated list of about 2000 of those. Uncommon and non-standard words, along with plurals, are generally never chosen as solutions. Hardmode can be enabled before starting a round, and restricts guesses to ones matching all previous clues. We can score a guess based on how many times it halves the set of possible solutions: a score of $1$ means there are half as many as before, while a score of $5$ means the set has been halved five times, resulting in $32$ times fewer solutions. Since there are close to $2048 = 2^{11}$ solutions initially, a total score of about $11$ is necessary to narrow it down to a single word. This assumes perfect knowledge of which words can appear as solutions, though, so in practice it usually takes more. Importantly, the score <strong>does not consider the actual solution.</strong>
	
	I was a few days into working on this when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA">3Blue1Brown</a> released a video</a> on nearly the same topic &mdash; for more on the scoring method, I recommend taking a look at it. Once you&#x2019;ve finished a Wordle, enter the solution here, along with your guesses, and click the info button to the left to see some of the best and worst guesses and their scores.
