		!text h Integer Partitions and Young Diagrams
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!text b j A <dfn>partition</dfn> of an integer $n$ is a sequence $(a_1, a_2, ... )$ with $a_i \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 0}$ and $a_i \geq a_{i + 1}$ for all $i$, such that $\sum_i a_i = n$.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1">
			!text b j Ex: $(5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...)$ is a partition of $13$.

		<div class="build build-2">
			!text b j The <dfn>Young diagram</dfn> corresponding to a partition $(a_i)$ is the set $\{(i, j) \in \mathbb{N}^2 \mid 1 \leq j \leq a_i\}$.

		<div class="build build-3">
			!text b j We usually treat these as top-left-justified sets of squares in a grid, so that $a_i$ is the length of row $i$.

		!text h Plane Partitions
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!text b j A <dfn>plane partition</dfn> is a placement of nonnegative integers into a Young diagram, such that the rows and columns weakly decrease. We can also think of them as a stacks of boxes, with each number indicating how many boxes are stacked on that square.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1">
			!text b j The weight of a plane partition $\pi$, written $|\pi|$, is just the sum of its entries, or equivalently the total number of boxes stacked.

		!text h RPPs and APPs
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!text b j If we require the rows and columns of a plane partition to weakly <em>increase</em> rather than decrease, the resulting object is called a <dfn>reverse plane partition</dfn>, or RPP.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1">
			!text b j Keeping the inequalities as usual but allowing entries to take on infinite values results in plane partitions <dfn>asymptotic</dfn> to $\mu$, where $\mu$ is the partition whose Young diagram appears as the infinite-height squares.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-2">
			!text b j Every plane partition is an APP with $\mu = \emptyset$, and every RPP is an APP for a suitably chosen $\mu$ (by rotating it $180^\circ$).

		!text h DT and PT
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!begin-text-block
			
				Donaldson-Thomas and Pandharipande-Thomas (DT and PT) theories are branches of enumerative geometry related to mirror symmetry and string theory.
			
				In both, particular generating functions counting topological vertices arise &mdash; those in DT enumerate APP-like objects, and those in PT enumerate RPP-like objects. Specifically,

				$W_{(\emptyset, \emptyset, \mu)}(q)$: RPPs of shape $\mu$.
				
				$M(q)$: plane partitions.

		<div class="build build-2">

		!text h The Main Theorem
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!begin-text-block
				
				For a partition $\mu$,
				
				$$
					V_{(\emptyset, \emptyset, \mu)}(q) = W_{(\emptyset, \emptyset, \mu)}(q) M(q).

			<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1">
			!begin-text-block
				
				Combinatorially, every APP $\alpha$ asymptotic to $\mu$ corresponds to a pair $(\rho, \pi)$ of an RPP $\rho$ of shape $\mu$ and a plane partition $\pi$, such that $|\alpha| = |\rho| + |\pi|$.
			
				A more general version of the theorem was proven algebraically by Helen Jenne, Gautam Webb, and Benjamin Young in 2020, but a simpler combinatorial proof is desirable &mdash; we will give one such.

		!text h Hooks and Hook Lengths
		
		<div class="build build-0 left-text">
			!text b j The <dfn>hook</dfn> corresponding to a box in an APP is the right-angled collection of boxes above and to the left of it. The hook length $h(i, j)$ of a box is the total number of boxes in its hook.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1 left-text">
			!text b j In an RPP, the direction of hooks is reserved along with the inequalities, and they extend down and right instead.

		<div class="build build-2">
			!text b j Combinatorially, APPs are in bijection with multisets of hooks, but it&#x2019;s not immediately clear how that bijection operates.

		!text h Hooks and Hook Lengths
		
		<div class="build build-0 left-text">
			!text b j Hillman and Grassl were the first to bijectivize the hook length formula for $V_{(\emptyset, \emptyset, \mu)}(q)$ by building APPs out of <dfn>zigzag paths</dfn> instead of hooks.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1 left-text">
			!text b j A zigzag path begins at the rightmost nonzero entry at the top of its column. It moves down if the entries are equal and left otherwise, until it can no longer move.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-3 left-text">
			!text b j The <dfn>pivot</dfn> of a zigzag path is the box with the path&#x2019;s starting column and ending row (indicated here in blue).
		</div>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div id="zigzag-paths-2" class="slide medium-canvas">
		!text b j A few important properties of zigzag paths:
		
		<div class="build build-0 left-text">
			!text b j Every APP either has a unique zigzag path or has weight zero.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1 left-text">
			!text b j Decrementing the boxes in a zigzag path preserves the plane partition inequalities.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-2 left-text">
			!text b j Every zigzag path has length equal to its pivot&#x2019;s hook length.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="slide">
		!text b j The Hillman-Grassl map is a bijection between APPs and multisets of hooks. It operates on an APP by decrementing its zigzag path, finding the zigzag path of the resulting APP and decrementing <em>it</em>, and so on, until eventually the APP has weight zero. At each step, we record the hook formed by reshaping the decremented path.
		
		<div class="build build-0">
			!text b j The removal of a zigzag path is an invertible operation, and it can be shown that the generated sequence of pivots respects an inverted lexicographic ordering, so given a multiset of pivots, the inverse Hillman-Grassl map is well-defined.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1">
			!text b j Since hooks are in bijection with pivots, we can concisely represent the multiset of hooks as a tableau (an unordered grid of numbers).

		!text h The Structure of the Bijection
		
		<div class="build build-0 left-text">
			!text b j It&#x2019;s generally easier to work with these unordered tableaux than APPs, since we can more freely rearrange the entries.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-1 left-text">
			!text b j In order for this to help us find our bijection, though, it needs to be true on the level of <em>hooks</em>, and not just on the level of boxes.
		</div>
		
		<div class="build build-2 left-text">
			!text b j Since every plane partition contains $n$ distinct $n$-hooks, we need to show that any APP has exactly enough extra $n$-hooks to fill up an RPP in the shape of its asymptote.

		<div class="build build-1 left-text">
			!text b j Treat the boundary as a sequence of vertical and horizontal edges, read from bottom-left to top-right. Then an ￼$n$-hook is just a vertical edge followed by a horizontal edge ￼$n$ positions later in the sequence.
