		My father sacrificed years and energy to homeschool me for the first eleven years of my life, opting not to place me in standard school. I took to math at an early age. My parents tell me I understood the concept of pi as it relates to circles by age three. I started reading the same year, and that may be why I developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia">grapheme-color synesthesia</a>, a curious, harmless condition that I consider myself fortunate to have.

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		My four grandparents were each spectacular in their own way, but I was arguably closest to my father&#x2019;s father, a math professor. Though I was already interested in math on my own, he undoubtedly inspired me to go further. At six years old, I knew I wanted to become a math professor too.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		I grew up, gathered a rough general knowledge, much different than the one I would have found in school. In most subjects, I had a working knowledge, but in math, I thrived, learning most of the core concepts of algebra by eleven. And I began thinking about going further &mdash; my parents&#x2019; plan had been for me to enroll in community college as a high school replacement when I was fourteen, but I was impatient, and ready.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		And so it was that my parents began to learn about how an eleven-year-old could attend community college.

		In the end, it was easier than any of us imagined. That loose association with a charter school helped, for I was able to register as an enrichment student because of it. My time at Cuesta was largely a coming-of-age story. Being surrounded by students ten or forty years older than me was an interesting experience, but one I adapted to quickly. I took one math class and one GE per semester, limited to eleven units, began working as a tutor after two years, and after two more, I was wearing a cap and gown, Cuesta&#x2019;s second-youngest graduate. I had applied to Cal Poly earlier that year and had been accepted, along with nearly every one of my friends. I was thrilled, and after four years and twenty-one classes, I left Cuesta&#x2019;s campus forever.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		Cal Poly was more challenging than I had expected, in ways I wasn't prepared for, but I made it through my first year unscathed. I even discovered a community of other math majors in the Math Lounge, a room little bigger than a one-bedroom apartment. Toward the end of the school year, I began toying with the idea of writing something, and started working on rough outlines. I was accepted for summer research, and when school started up again in the fall, I was well-prepared for senior-level classes.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		They were much harder than what had come before, but I made it through algebra and both real and complex analysis. Somewhere along the way, I became the unofficial leader of the Lounge, and between the organization and planning that entailed and the attention classes commanded, I had my hands full, barely finding time to keep working on my outline.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		And then I graduated from Cal Poly, too, with a 4.0. I chose to take a gap year, and remained in San Luis Obispo for the remainder of the summer, taking care of loose ends. I began a rough draft of my book, slowly LaTeXed my notes, converting them into the documents hosted here, and studied for the foreboding GRE. I even found time to start playing disc golf.

		Grad school applications are out, and the GRE marches steadily closer. My hands will be full for the next two months before I leave for Germany. There, I will attend a language school for three months before travelling the country, <a href="http://wwoof.net/">WWOOFing</a>. I&#x2019;ll return to San Luis sometime in April, see the majority of the Lounge graduate, and finally leave for grad school. It is an exciting, hectic, and terrifying time, and the future looms so close I can feel it.
