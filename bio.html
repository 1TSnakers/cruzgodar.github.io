		My parents saw something in me that I still struggle to see in myself at times. My mother was, and is, a midwife, a full-time, full-life job, but my father, finding that life after J.D. was bleaker than law school, sacrificed time and energy and opportunities and patience to homeschool me. For eleven years, I flirted with charter schools and regular curricula, but neither seemed to connect. I learned more through exploration and inquisition than rote memorization, and as such, I clashed with everything <i>school</i>.
	</div>
	
	<br>
	
	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		I took to math &mdash; and symbols in general &mdash; at an early age. My parents tell me I understood the concept of pi as it relates to circles by age three. I started reading the same year, and that may be why I developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia">grapheme-color synesthesia</a>, a curious, harmless condition that I consider myself fortunate to have.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="250" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		I had four grandparents, and each was spectacular in their own way, but I was arguably closest to my father&#x2019;s father, a math professor. He and my grandmother would drive the two hours to our house more times than I can count (now or then), and though I was already interested in math on my own, he undoubtedly inspired me to go further. At six years old, I knew I wanted to become a math professor.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		I grew up. I gathered a rough general knowledge, much different than the one I would have found in school. In most subjects, I had a working knowledge, if not a complete one, except in math. There I thrived, learning most of the core concepts of algebra by age eleven. And I began thinking about going further &mdash; my family&#x2019;s plan had been for me to enroll in high school at age fifteen with the masses, but I was impatient, and ready, and didn&#x2019;t like the idea of high school anyway, from what I had heard.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="350" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-1">
		And so it was that my parents began to learn about how an eleven-year-old could attend community college.
	</div>

	<div style="height: 10vh"></div>

	<div class="section-text" data-aos="fade-up" id="trigger-section-2">Cuesta</div>

	<div style="height: 5vh"></div>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="50" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		In the end, it was easier than any of us imagined. That loose association with a charter school helped, for I was able to register as an enrichment student because of it. Enrichment students are limited to nine units per semester in California (though it is possible to petition, as I later did, for the federal limit of eleven). I tested into Precalculus and started, at my mother&#x2019;s urging, one class below, in Algebra II. It was a smart decision. That alone was only five units, so I took a computer programming class alongside. I&#x2019;d had little expreience with coding before then, and learning C, I had no idea that there was anything easier to use. Perhaps that was as well &mdash; I still think python spoils its users.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		Cuesta was largely a coming-of-age story. Being surrounded by students ten or forty years older than you will put on the fast track to maturity, and I think I avoided many adolescent cliches because of it (except a large ego, apparently, given that I&#x2019;ve written six paragraphs lauding myself). Nevertheless, it was two years before I made a single friend. I met Nick in Calculus II among a truly remarkable class. We didn&#x2019;t talk until the next semester, when we both became tutors in Cuesta&#x2019;s Math Lab. It was my first job, and it was both incredibly fulfilling and incredibly humbling. Having a passion for teaching is not enough, especially as a fast-talking fourteen-year-old. Over the next two years, I would slowly &mdash; and, at times, painfully &mdash; hone that ability until explaining a concept slowly, carefully, and simply was... well, if not second nature, then third.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		I was lucky enough to have the same excellent professor for all three semesters of calculus and the introductory linear analysis course Cuesta offered. I took physics, a fresh and engaging class to pair with math, and suddenly, before I quite knew it, I was wearing a cap and gown.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
		Due to my own ineptitude, I didn&#x2019;t get an associate degree, since I was missing a single GE class, but I walked nonetheless, Cuesta&#x2019;s second-youngest graduate. I had applied to Cal Poly earlier that year and had been accepted, along with nearly every one of my friends. I was thrilled. In the summer that followed, I worked as an embedded tutor with my physics profesor and finally, after four years and twenty-one classes, I left Cuesta&#x2019;s campus forever.

	<div class="section-text" data-aos="fade-up" id="trigger-section-3">Cal Poly</div>

	<div style="height: 5vh"></div>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="50" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		I came to the university nervous and with one true friend to my name &mdash; Nick had switched from manufacturing to math, and so we were in many of the same classes. Even still, my first two quarters were lonely as well as challenging. I struggled to adapt to proof-based math, especially when I was trying to learn new material at the same time. My GEs were easier, and I even took an elective year of German, the best non-credit classes I&#x2019;ve ever taken. Graf, if you ever read this, know that you&#x2019;re a legend.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		My professors at Cal Poly were outstanding. Full stop. I was unbelivably lucky to have the best professors of an already great department be teaching the classes I was taking at the right times. Every one of the names on my notes is a professor well worth taking.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		I didn&#x2019;t make friends. It was like the first two years of Cuesta all over again, except that this time I actually cared. It was as clear to me then as it is now that I acted like the introvert I was not, but while four years spent around students far older than you will make you mature, it has the side effect of a nontrivial amount of shyness. I would gladly talk to people, I just wouldn&#x2019;t initiate conversations. Over those first two quarters, I made only one new friend, largely with Nick&#x2019;s help, and though we held weekly board game nights, it wasn&#x2019;t enough.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		And then one day in spring quarter 2017, I happened to be in a conversation of some sort with a fellow student in Number Theory after class. He was walking somewhere, so I followed, and I found myself in a room little bigger than a one-bedroom apartment, outfitted with four tables, a bunch of chairs and a couch. It was the Math Lounge, and it would become my second home.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="250" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		I didn&#x2019;t really know anyone in there, of course, but the door was keycarded, and only math majors and minors could enter, so no one questioned my presence. There was a clear leader, loud and proud and universally known, and though I wouldn&#x2019;t learn it until much later, she was preceeded by someone even more famous. I was little more than an extra. Still, I sat in the Lounge in all my spare hours, occationally talking to someone &mdash; I was still shy &mdash; but mostly watching the seniors come and go. I was in awe of them, getting up in a group the same time each day to march off to graduate algebra or some other topic that was surely years away from me. Never mind that I was a junior.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		The end of spring came quickly, and with it, the seniors graduated. The Lounge was five members fewer, but with their importance, it felt like most. I had applied for summer research, and that occupied most of my break. By the time school started again in the fall, the Lounge had grown accustomed to the abscence of its most prominent members.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="350" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		I speak of the Lounge as a single being, but it wasn&#x2019;t really that way until Abstract Algebra I that fall. That class, made famously, fiendishly difficult by its teacher, brought an influx of students to the Lounge that hasn&#x2019;t been seen since. There are more than thirty of us, and at our most crowded, we can push twenty of us there at the same time. Math gets done, but there&#x2019;s an equal amount of visiting and relaxing, if not more. It is a truly special place, and somehow, over the next year, I ended up as its unofficial leader. I organized most of the group events, saw others&#x2019; suggestions through to fruition, and spent hours upon hours in the Lounge, talking and working and helping others. I coordinated a group picture at the end of spring quarter, then got it printed as a large poster and mounted it on the Lounge wall. Every member, frequent or occasional, serious or light, motherly or snarky, holds a special place in my heart.
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-3">
		And then I graduated from Cal Poly, too. I actually did get a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, thankfully, and I&#x2019;ve remained in San Luis Obispo for the remainder of the summer. Last spring, shortly after I discovered the Lounge, I began thinking about writing a book, and over the past year, I&#x2019;ve whittled away at an outline in my spare time, finally beginning a rough draft after graduation. I&#x2019;ve slowly LaTeXed my notes, converting them into the documents hosted here, and I&#x2019;ve studied for the forboding GRE this fall.
	</div>

	<div style="height: 10vh"></div>

	<div class="section-text" data-aos="fade-up" id="trigger-section-4">Forward</div>

	<div style="height: 5vh"></div>

	<div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="50" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-4">
		Grad school applications are out, and the GRE marches steadily closer. My hands will be full for the next two months before I leave for Germany. There, I will attend a language school for three months before travelling the country, <a href="http://wwoof.net/">WWOOFing</a>. I&#x2019;ll return to San Luis sometime in April, see the majority of the Lounge graduate once again, and finally leave for grad school. It is an exciting, hectic, and terrifying time, and the future looms so close I can feel it.
