## What is it?

My personal website. If you're just here to see it, go to [cruzgodar.com](https://cruzgodar.com). It contains the novels and short stories I've written, materials for the classes I've taught, and JavaScript applets I've created, among other things.

---

## Why does it exist?

Because anyone who wants to read my writing, view my class material, or use my applets needs a place to go, and that place deserves to be polished.

## How does it work?

Complete documentation is available under the docs folder. This is primarily for me in case I forget how something works, but if you're interested in an explanation of the site's inner workings, check it out [here](docs/overview.md).
