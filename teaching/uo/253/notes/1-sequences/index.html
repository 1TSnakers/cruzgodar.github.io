	When learning math, it&#x2019;s helpful to have an idea of the big picture at as many levels possible. At times the definitions, theorems, and examples can feel like slogging through tall grass, and without a clear picture of where you&#x2019;re going and why, it can seem a little pointless. First, let&#x2019;s run down what we&#x2019;ll be building over the entire course.
	
	Throughout all of calculus I and II, the easiest type of functions to work with are polynomials. Limits, derivatives, and integrals are all easy when the function you&#x2019;re working with is a polynomial, since all three split across addition, so you can take them term-by-term. Moreover, each term of a polynomial is a continuous function, so limits are as easy as plugging in the number you&#x2019;re limiting to, and derivatives and integrals just leverage the power rule.
	
	It goes without saying that not all functions are polynomials. $\sin(x)$, $\ln(x)$, and $2^x$ are all substantially more complicated, and there is no way to write any as a sun of monomials. But let&#x2019;s take a close look at $\sin(x)$.

	Drag the blue point around, and try increasing $N$. The green function is always a polynomial, and it is almost exactly equal to $\sin(x)$, as long as you only look near the blue point. As $N$ increases, so does the length of the interval where the two functions are almost identical. It will turn out that as $N \to \infty$, that interval becomes infinitely long, and the functions agree everywhere. So $\sin$ may not be a polynomial, but it is a <em>limit</em> of polynomials. This is a very different kind of limit from the one we&#x2019;re used to, though &mdash; rather than a sequence of numbers approaching another number, what we have here is a sequence of <em>functions</em> approaching another function. The upshot of this intricate construction is that many of the best properties of polynomials will carry over to limits of them, so working with $\sin$ &mdash; and more importantly, other more complicated functions &mdash; will be made much easier.
	
	We&#x2019;ll spend the first half of the course building tools and machinery in order to understand the ideas of adding together infinitely many functions that can sometimes converge. In the second half, we&#x2019;ll specialize to the specific kind of sums that approximate functions, like we just did with $\sin$. While many of the topics we cover will be interesting in their own right, it&#x2019;s good to keep this rough roadmap in mind as we move from one to the next.

!text s Sequences

<br>

!begin-text-block
	
	In order to talk about the complex behavior of the polynomials we just saw, we need to build the groundwork of <dfn>sequences</dfn>. As with every topic, we&#x2019;ll start with a definition, give some examples and exercises, and then talk about some basic properties.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	sequence
	
	A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is an infinite list of numbers, written
	
	$$
		(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...).
	$$
	
	We can write this concisely as $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$, or more commonly, just $(a_n)$. The $a_n$ are called <dfn>terms</dfn> of the sequence, and $n$ is called the <dfn>index variable</dfn>.
	
	The alternate notation $\{a_n\}$ is often used, including in our textbook. In general, curly braces denote collections of numbers where order and duplicates don&#x2019;t matter, and parentheses denote collections where they do matter, as in ordered pairs $(x, y)$. Since order and duplicates do matter in sequences, we will be using the parentheses notation in these notes.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	writing out a sequence from a formula
	
	Let $a_n = 2n$, $b_n = n^2 + 1$, and $c_n = (n - 1)!$. Write out the first ten terms of the sequences $(a_n)$, $(b_n)$, and $(c_n)$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s start with $(a_n)$. Unless otherwise specified, sequences start with $n = 1$, so the first term is $a_1 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$. Plugging in $n = 2$ through $n = 5$, we find that
	
	$$
		(a_n) = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...).
	$$
	
	Similarly, we have
	
	$$
		(b_n) = (2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ...).
	$$
	
	Now let&#x2019;s look at $(c_n)$. That exclamation point is a <dfn>factorial</dfn>: to take the factorial of a positive integer $n$, multiply together all the integers less than or equal to $n$. For example,
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			1! &= 1.\\
			2! &= 2 \cdot 1 = 2.\\
			3! &= 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6.\\
			4! &= 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	We also define $0! = 1$. That might seem weird, but we&#x2019;ll be making heavy use of factorials later in the course, and we&#x2019;ll really want it to be defined that way. Putting everything together, we have
	
	$$
		(c_n) = (1, 1, 2, 6, 24, ...).
	$$
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	A formula in terms of $n$ that defines a sequence &mdash; like all three in the previous example &mdash; is called an <dfn>explicit formula</dfn>. We can also define sequences <dfn>recursively</dfn> by writing $a_n$ in terms of $a_{n - 1}$, $a_{n - 2}$, and so on. Let&#x2019;s take a look at how these work.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	sequences defined recursively
	
	Let $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = 2a_{n - 1}$. Write out the first five terms of $(a_n)$ and find an explicit formula for $(a_n)$.
	
	Whenever a sequence is defined recursively, there must be at least one term of the sequence written down exactly, so that we have a place to start from. Here, that&#x2019;s $a_1 = 1$. From here, let&#x2019;s use the recursion to find $a_2$. Plugging in $n = 2$ to $a_n = 2a_{n - 1}$, we have 
	
	$$
		a_2 = 2a_1 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2.
	$$
	
	Now with $n = 3$, we have
	
	$$
		a_3 = 2a_2 = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
	$$
	
	Continuing in this way, we have
	
	$$
		(a_n) = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
	$$
	
	To write this as an explicit formula, we need to know what $a_n$ is in terms of only $n$, and not any previous $a_i$. Here, that&#x2019;s not too hard: each term is a power of $2$. It&#x2019;s tempting to say that the formula is $a_n = 2^n$, but let&#x2019;s check that idea: with $n = 1$, we get $a_1 = 2^1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 2^2 = 4$. The pattern matches, but the power is one too high on each. To fix that, we&#x2019;ll just take one off to get $a_n = 2^{n - 1}$.
	
	To check our answer, let&#x2019;s plug it into the recurrence. We have $a_1 = 2^{1 - 1} = 1$ and
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			a_n &= 2a_{n - 1}\\
			&= 2(2^{n - 1})\\
			&= 2^n,
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	which is exactly correct!

!begin-exercise
	
	sequences
	
	1. The Fibonacci numbers are a very famous sequence that begin with $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$. After this, every Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two. Find a recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence $(F_n)$.
	
	2. Find a recursive formula for each of the three sequences in the first example.
	
	3. Let $(d_n)$ be a sequence defined by $d_1 = 0$ and $d_n = d_{n - 1} + \frac{1}{2^n}$. Find an explicit formula for $(d_n)$ by writing out terms and finding a pattern, and verify your answer by plugging it back into the recurrence.
