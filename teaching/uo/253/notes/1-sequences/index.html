The definitions and theorems and examples can feel like slogging through tall grass, and without a clear picture of where you&#x2019;re going and why, it can all seem a little pointless. First, let&#x2019;s run down what we&#x2019;ll be building over the entire course.</p><br><p class="body-text">Throughout all of calculus I and II, the easiest type of functions to work with are polynomials. Limits, derivatives, and integrals are all easy when the function you&#x2019;re operating on is a polynomial, since all three split across addition, so you can take them term-by-term. Moreover, every term of a polynomial is a continuous function, so limits are as easy as plugging in the number you&#x2019;re limiting to, and derivatives and integrals just leverage the power rule.</p><br><p class="body-text">It goes without saying that not all functions are polynomials. $\sin(x)$, $\ln(x)$, and $2^x$ are all substantially more complicated, and there is no way to write any as a sum of monomials. But we&#x2019;re not as far off as you might think &mdash; let&#x2019;s take a close look at $\sin(x)$.</p><br><div class="desmos-border"><div id="taylor-series" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Drag the blue point around, and try increasing $N$. The blue function is always a polynomial, and it is almost exactly equal to $\sin(x)$, as long as you only look near the blue point. As $N$ increases, so does the length of the interval where the two functions agree. It will turn out that as $N \to \infty$, that interval becomes infinitely long, and the functions become exactly equal to one another. So $\sin$ may not be a polynomial, but it is a <em>limit</em> of polynomials. This is a very different kind of limit from the one we&#x2019;re used to, though &mdash; rather than a sequence of numbers approaching another number, what we have here is a sequence of <em>functions</em> approaching another function. The upshot of this intricate construction is that many of the best properties of polynomials will carry over to their limits, so working with $\sin$ &mdash; and more importantly, other more complicated functions &mdash; will be made much easier.</p><br><p class="body-text">We&#x2019;ll spend the first half of the course building tools and machinery in order to understand the ideas of adding together infinitely many functions that can sometimes converge. In the second half, we&#x2019;ll specialize to the specific kind of sums that approximate functions, like we just did with $\sin$. While many of the topics we cover will be interesting in their own right, it&#x2019;s good to keep this rough roadmap in mind as we move from one to the next.</p><br></section><section><h2 class="section-text">Sequences</h2><br><p class="body-text">To talk about the complex behavior of the polynomials we just saw, we need to build the groundwork of <dfn>sequences</dfn>. As with every topic, we&#x2019;ll start with a definition, give some examples and exercises, and then talk about some properties.</p><br><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: sequence</span></p><br><p class="body-text">A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is an infinite list of numbers, written</p><p class="body-text">$$(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...).$$</p><p class="body-text">We can write this concisely as $(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$, or more commonly, just $(a_n)$. The $a_n$ are called <dfn>terms</dfn> of the sequence, and $n$ is called the <dfn>index variable</dfn>.</p><br><p class="body-text">The alternate notation $\{a_n\}$ is often used, including in our textbook. In general, though, curly braces denote collections of numbers where order and duplicates don&#x2019;t matter, and parentheses denote collections where they do matter, like in ordered pairs $(x, y)$. Since order and duplicates do matter in sequences, we&#x2019;ll use the parentheses notation in these notes.</p><br></div><div class="notes-example notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-example-title">Example: writing out a sequence from a formula</span></p><br><p class="body-text">Let $a_n = 2n$, $b_n = n^2 + 1$, and $c_n = (n - 1)!$. Write out the first five terms of the sequences $(a_n)$, $(b_n)$, and $(c_n)$.</p><br><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s start with $(a_n)$. Unless otherwise specified, sequences start with $n = 1$, so the first term is $a_1 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$.

That exclamation point is a <dfn>factorial</dfn>: to take the factorial of a positive integer $n$, multiply together all the integers less than or equal to $n$. For example,</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}1! &= 1.\\2! &= 2 \cdot 1 = 2.\\3! &= 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6.\\4! &= 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">We also define $0! = 1$. That might seem weird, but we&#x2019;ll be making heavy use of factorials later in the course, and we&#x2019;ll really want it to be defined that way. Putting everything together, we have</p><p class="body-text">$$(c_n) = (1, 1, 2, 6, 24, ...).$$</p></div><p class="body-text">A formula in terms of $n$ that defines a sequence &mdash; like all three in the previous example &mdash; is called an <dfn>explicit formula</dfn>. We can also define sequences <dfn>recursively</dfn> by writing $a_n$ in terms of $a_{n - 1}$, $a_{n - 2}$, and so on. Let&#x2019;s take a look at how these work.</p><br><div class="notes-example notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-example-title">Example: a sequence defined recursively</span></p><br><p class="body-text">Let $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = 2a_{n - 1}$.

Here, that&#x2019;s not too hard: each term is a power of $2$. It&#x2019;s tempting to say that the formula is $a_n = 2^n$, but let&#x2019;s check that idea: with $n = 1$, we get $a_1 = 2^1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 2^2 = 4$. The pattern matches, but the power is one too high on each. To fix that, we&#x2019;ll just take one off to get $a_n = 2^{n - 1}$.</p><br><p class="body-text">To check our answer, let&#x2019;s plug it into the recurrence. We have $a_1 = 2^{1 - 1} = 1$ and</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}a_n &= 2a_{n - 1}\\&= 2(2^{n - 1})\\&= 2^n,\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">which is exactly correct!</p><br></div><div class="notes-exercise notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-exercise-title">Exercise: sequences</span></p><br><p class="body-text">1.

Since every $F_n$ is the sum of the previous two, $F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$.

Therefore, we have</p><p class="body-text">$$a_1 = 2, a_n = a_{n - 1} + 2.$$</p><p class="body-text">The $b_n$ are a little more complicated. Looking at the differences between successive terms, we have</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}5 - 2 &= 3\\10 - 5 &= 5\\17 - 10 &= 7\\26 - 17 &= 9.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">We seem to be adding $2$ more every time, starting with $2$. So $b_2 = 2\cdot 1 + 1 + b_1$, $b_3 = 2\cdot 2 + 1 + b_2$, and so on. The pattern winds up looking like</p><p class="body-text">$$b_1 = 2, b_n = 2(n - 1) + 1 + b_{n-1}.$$</p><p class="body-text">An alternative way to arrive at the same solution is to look at $b_n - b_{n - 1}$. Using the explicit formula, this becomes</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}n^2 + 1 - ((n-1)^2 + 1) &= n^2 - (n-1)^2\\&= n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1)\\&= 2n - 1.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">Therefore, $b_n = b_{n - 1} + 2n - 1$.</p><br><p class="body-text">With $c_n$, rather than adding terms, we&#x2019;re multiplying to get from one to the next.

This sequence is matched by the function $1 - \frac{1}{x}$. As $x \to \infty$, $\frac{1}{x} \to 0$, so $1 - \frac{1}{x} \to 1$. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is $1$.</p><br><p class="body-text">3. We can use the same strategy as the previous question, but this time we need to apply L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule.
