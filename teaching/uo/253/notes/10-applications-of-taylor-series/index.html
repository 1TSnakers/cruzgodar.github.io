!begin-text-block

	In this final section, we&#x2019;ll use Taylor series to their full extent, solving two types of problems that were previously impossible to us: differential equations and integrals. We&#x2019;ve seen ways to solve both in Caclulus II, but that was far from a complete description: for example, the differential equation
	
	$$
		y'' = xy
	$$
	
	and the integral
	
	$$
		\int e^{-x^2}\ dx
	$$
	
	both present substantial challanges. By the end of this section, we&#x2019;ll be able to solve both with Taylor series, and the theory we started developing ten sections ago will largely be complete. Before we dive in, let&#x2019;s briefly restate the most important Taylor series we know. If possible, we like to center them at $x = 0$, which occasionally involves adjusting the argument of the function in consideration to make the math work out more easily. After each series is its interval of convergence.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{1}{1 - x} &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots & (-1, 1)\\
			e^x &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)\\
			\ln(1 + x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^{n + 1} \frac{x^n}{n} = 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} + \cdots & (-1, 1]\\
			\sin(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} - \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)\\
			\cos(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} - \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)
		\end{align*}
	$$

!text s Power Functions and Binomial Coefficients

<br>



!begin-text-block

	While that list covers most of the functions we typically come across, there&#x2019;s one glaring omission: power functions! Something as simple as $x^{1/2}$ leaves us unable to form a Taylor series, and before we jump into differential equations and integrals, we&#x2019;ll need to patch up this gap in our knowledge.
	
	As with natural log, the math works out <em>much</em> more easily if we consider the function $f(x) = (1 + x)^r$ rather than just $x^r$. This is because we&#x2019;d ideally like to center our series at $x = 0$, and power functions don&#x2019;t do too well there. For some, like $x^{1/2}$, that&#x2019;s the edge of their domain, so our radius of convergence would be forced to be zero. For others, like $x^{1/3}$, the derivative at zero is undefined since the tangent line is vertical, meaning we couldn&#x2019;t extract the Taylor coefficients we need in the first place. By adding $1$ and centering at $0$, we&#x2019;re effectively centering a series for $x^r$ at $x = 1$, which will turn out to be perfect.
	
	So, with $f(x) = (1 + x)^r$ for a real number $r$, what is $f^{(n)}(0)$? That&#x2019;s not too bad to figure out: just apply the power rule $n$ times. We wind up with
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f'(x) &= r(1 + x)^{r - 1}\\
			f''(x) &= r(r - 1)(1 + x)^{r - 2}\\
			f'''(x) &= r(r - 1)(r - 2)(1 + x)^{r - 3}\\
			\ & \vdots\\
			f^{(n)}(x) &= r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)(1 + x)^{r - n}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The last factor being $r - n + 1$ and not $r - n$ is a little confusing at first, but it&#x2019;s because we start at $r = 0$.
	
	To get Taylor coefficients out of this, we need to evaluate at zero and divide by $n!$. Conveniently, setting $x = 0$ makes $(1 + x)^{r - n} = 1$, so we just have
	
	$$
		\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} = \frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)}{n!}.
	$$
	
	You might recognize this expression: when $r$ is a positive integer larger than $n$, the top of the fraction looks a lot like $r!$, except that we remove all the factors up through $(r - n)$. In other words, the fraction is just
	
	$$
		\frac{r!}{n!(r - n)!} = \binom{r}{n}.
	$$
	
	The expression on the right is a <dfn>binomial coefficient</dfn>, read as &#x201C;$r$ choose $n$&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s equal to the number of ways to choose $n$ objects out of a pile of $r$ objects, where the order in which you choose the $n$ doesn&#x2019;t matter. When $r$ is a real number and not necessarily a positive integer, $r!$ isn&#x2019;t defined, but we&#x2019;d really like to have a convenient notation for these Taylor coefficients. The easiest solution is to extend the definition of binomial coefficients to have real-valued top values, allowing us to use them no matter the value of $r$.

!begin-def

	generalized binomial coefficient
	
	Let $r$ be a real number and let $n$ be a positive integer. The <dfn>generalized binomial coefficient</dfn> $\binom{r}{n}$ is defined to be
	
	$$
		\binom{r}{n} = \frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)}{n!}.
	$$

!end-def



!begin-text-block

	Now our Taylor coefficients are just generalized binomial coefficients: that is, the Maclaurin series for $(1 + x)^r$ is
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{r}{n} x^n.
	$$
	
	If $r$ is a positive integer, then $\binom{r}{n}$ will eventually contain a factor of $(r - (r + 1) + 1) = 0$ in the numerator, meaning the Maclaurin series will only have terms up to $x^r$. This makes perfect sense, though: when $r$ is a positive integer, $(1 + x)^r$ is a polynomial, so it shouldn&#x2019;t have an infinite series representation centered at $0$. It&#x2019;s the other values of $r$ that we&#x2019;d expect to have infinite representations.
