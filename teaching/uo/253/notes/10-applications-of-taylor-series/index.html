	In this final section, we&#x2019;ll use Taylor series to their full extent, solving two types of problems that were previously impossible to us: differential equations and integrals. We&#x2019;ve seen ways to solve both in Caclulus II, but that was far from a complete description: for example, the differential equation
	
	$$
		y'' = xy
	$$
	
	and the integral
	
	$$
		\int e^{-x^2}\ dx
	$$
	
	both present substantial challanges. By the end of this section, we&#x2019;ll be able to solve both with Taylor series, and the theory we started developing ten sections ago will largely be complete. Before we dive in, let&#x2019;s briefly restate the most important Taylor series we know. If possible, we like to center them at $x = 0$, which occasionally involves adjusting the argument of the function in consideration to make the math work out more easily. After each series is its interval of convergence.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{1}{1 - x} &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots & (-1, 1)\\
			e^x &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)\\
			\ln(1 + x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^{n + 1} \frac{x^n}{n} = 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} + \cdots & (-1, 1]\\
			\sin(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} - \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)\\
			\cos(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} - \cdots & (-\infty, \infty)
		\end{align*}

!text s Power Functions and Binomial Coefficients

<br>



!begin-text-block

	While that list covers most of the functions we typically come across, there&#x2019;s one glaring omission: power functions! Something as simple as $x^{1/2}$ leaves us unable to form a Taylor series, and before we jump into differential equations and integrals, we&#x2019;ll need to patch up this gap in our knowledge.
	
	As with natural log, the math works out <em>much</em> more easily if we consider the function $f(x) = (1 + x)^r$ rather than just $x^r$. This is because we&#x2019;d ideally like to center our series at $x = 0$, and power functions don&#x2019;t do too well there. For some, like $x^{1/2}$, that&#x2019;s the edge of their domain, so our radius of convergence would be forced to be zero. For others, like $x^{1/3}$, the derivative at zero is undefined since the tangent line is vertical, meaning we couldn&#x2019;t extract the Taylor coefficients we need in the first place. By adding $1$ and centering at $0$, we&#x2019;re effectively centering a series for $x^r$ at $x = 1$, which will turn out to be perfect.
	
	So, with $f(x) = (1 + x)^r$ for a real number $r$, what is $f^{(n)}(0)$? That&#x2019;s not too bad to figure out: just apply the power rule $n$ times. We wind up with
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f'(x) &= r(1 + x)^{r - 1}\\
			f''(x) &= r(r - 1)(1 + x)^{r - 2}\\
			f'''(x) &= r(r - 1)(r - 2)(1 + x)^{r - 3}\\
			& \ \ \vdots\\
			f^{(n)}(x) &= r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)(1 + x)^{r - n}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The last factor being $r - n + 1$ and not $r - n$ is a little confusing at first, but it&#x2019;s because we start at $r = 0$.
	
	To get Taylor coefficients out of this, we need to evaluate at zero and divide by $n!$. Conveniently, setting $x = 0$ makes $(1 + x)^{r - n} = 1$, so we just have
	
	$$
		\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} = \frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)}{n!}.
	$$
	
	You might recognize this expression: when $r$ is a positive integer larger than $n$, the top of the fraction looks a lot like $r!$, except that we remove all the factors up through $(r - n)$. In other words, the fraction is just
	
	$$
		\frac{r!}{n!(r - n)!} = \binom{r}{n}.
	$$
	
	The expression on the right is a <dfn>binomial coefficient</dfn>, read as &#x201C;$r$ choose $n$&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s equal to the number of ways to choose $n$ objects out of a pile of $r$ objects, where the order in which you choose the $n$ doesn&#x2019;t matter. When $r$ is a real number and not necessarily a positive integer, $r!$ isn&#x2019;t defined, but we&#x2019;d really like to have a convenient notation for these Taylor coefficients. The easiest solution is to extend the definition of binomial coefficients to have real-valued top values, allowing us to use them no matter the value of $r$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def

	generalized binomial coefficient
	
	Let $r$ be a real number and let $n$ be a positive integer. The <dfn>generalized binomial coefficient</dfn> $\binom{r}{n}$ is defined to be
	
	$$
		\binom{r}{n} = \frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)}{n!}.
	$$

!end-def



!begin-text-block

	Now our Taylor coefficients are just generalized binomial coefficients: that is, the Maclaurin series for $(1 + x)^r$ is
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{r}{n} x^n.
	$$
	
	If $r$ is a positive integer, then $\binom{r}{n}$ will eventually contain a factor of $(r - (r + 1) + 1) = 0$ in the numerator, meaning the Maclaurin series will only have terms up to $x^r$. This makes perfect sense, though: when $r$ is a positive integer, $(1 + x)^r$ is a polynomial, so it shouldn&#x2019;t have an infinite series representation centered at $0$. It&#x2019;s the other values of $r$ that we&#x2019;d expect to have infinite representations.
	
	So, when does this series converge? The series is full of exponents and factorials, so let&#x2019;s try the ratio test. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\binom{r}{n + 1} x^{n + 1}}{\binom{r}{n} x^n} \right| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n)}{(n + 1)!} x^{n + 1}}{\frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1)}{n!} x^n} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n) n! x^{n + 1}}{r(r - 1)(r - 2) \cdots (r - n + 1) (n + 1)! x^n} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(r - n) x}{n + 1} \right|\\
			&= |x| \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{r - n}{n + 1} \right|\\
			&= |x|.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, the series converges when $|x| < 1$, and so the interval of convergence is $(-1, 1)$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example

	the Maclaurin series for $(1 + x)^r$
	
	Approximate $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ with a degree-4 Taylor polynomial and bound the error.
	
	At first glance, we might want to express this as $2^{-1/2}$ and use the Maclaurin series for $(1 + x)^{-1/2}$, but that would require setting $x = 1$, which is just barely outside the interval of convergence. Instead, we can write $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ as $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{1/2}$. That way, we can use $(1 + x)^{1/2}$ with $x = -\frac{1}{2}$, which is in $(-1, 1)$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s calculate the degree-4 Maclaurin polynomial. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			&\ \ \ \ \binom{1/2}{0} + \binom{1/2}{1} x + \binom{1/2}{2} x^2 + \binom{1/2}{3} x^3 + \binom{1/2}{4} x^4\\
			&= 1 + \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1} x + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}{2!} x^2 + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)}{3!} x^3 + \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)}{4!} x^4\\
			&= 1 + \frac{1}{2} x - \frac{1}{8} x^2 + \frac{1}{16} x^3 - \frac{5}{128} x^4.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Plugging in $x = -\frac{1}{2}$ gives us
	
	$$
		1 - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{32} - \frac{1}{128} - \frac{5}{2048} \approx .7085.
	$$
	
	To bound the error, we need to bound $|f^{(5)}(x)|$ on $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$. That derivative evaluates to
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			|f^{(5)}(x)| &= \left| \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{7}{2}\right)(1 + x)^{-9/2} \right|\\
			&= \left| \frac{\frac{105}{32}}{(1 + x)^{9/2}} \right|.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	How large can this be? The smaller that $1 + x$ is, the larger the expression will be, so the largest it could possibly get is when $x = -\frac{1}{2}$. Then we have
	
	$$
		|f^{(5)}(x)| \leq \left| \frac{\frac{105}{32}}{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{9/2}} \right| \approx 74.246.
	$$
	
	By Taylor&#x2019;s theorem, the maximum error is then
	
	$$
		\frac{74.246}{5!} \left|\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 0\right|^5 \approx .0193.
	$$
	
	This looks about right &mdash; the actual value of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is approximately $.7071$, and our estimate was $.7085$, so the error was about $.0014$, which is definitely less than $.0193$.

!text s Taylor Series and Differential Equations

<br>



!begin-text-block

	As we mentioned in section 8, power series have the excellent property of being differentiable term-by-term, and from an exercise last section, we saw how to use them to represent solutions to differential equations: by letting $y = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n$ be a generic Maclaurin series and setting $y' = y$, we were able to find a series representation for $e^x$. As we so often do in math, we&#x2019;ll now work in the opposite direction: if we&#x2019;re given a differential equation like $y' = y$ instead of setting it up ourselves, we can still solve for a Taylor series solution. In the best case, we&#x2019;ll recognize it as a function we know, but even if we don&#x2019;t, we&#x2019;ll still have solved the equation.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example

	solving a differential equation with power series
	
	Find a power series solution to $y'' = xy$.
	
	We&#x2019;re trying to solve for $y$ here, so let&#x2019;s take a generic power series $y = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n$. We&#x2019;re assuming that $y$ <em>has</em> a power series representation in the first place, which requires $y$ to be infinitely differentiable and also not be some sort of pathological case like $e^{-1/x^2}$. While very few functions meet those criteria, most of the ones we care about do, and so it&#x2019;s not too much to assume. Plus, the worst that can happen is that we figure out that no such representation exists and have to give up, so we might as well try.
	
	Getting everything in terms of power series tells us that
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n &= x \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^n\\
			\sum_{n = 2}^\infty c_n(n)(n - 1) x^{n - 2} &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n x^{n + 1}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	In order to figure out what the $c_n$ should be, it helps to make the powers on $x$ match. To make them both $x^n$, we can start the left sum at $n = 0$ and the right sum at $n = 1$ to get
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_{n + 2}(n + 2)(n + 1) x^n = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty c_{n - 1} x^n.
	$$
	
	Now we can see that $c_{n + 2}(n + 2)(n + 1) = c_{n - 1}$ for $n \geq 1$. For $n = 0$, the right sum has no $x^0$ term, so the equation is just $c_2(2)(1) = 0$. In total, our system of equations looks like this:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			c_2 &= 0\\
			c_3 &= \frac{c_0}{3 \cdot 2}\\
			c_4 &= \frac{c_1}{4 \cdot 3}\\
			c_5 &= \frac{c_2}{5 \cdot 4}\\
			c_6 &= \frac{c_3}{6 \cdot 5}\\
			& \ \ \vdots
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	This is a little tricky to parse, but it&#x2019;s not too terrible. First of all,
