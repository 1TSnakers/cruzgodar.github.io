!begin-text-block
	
	With a strong foundation of sequences built up, let&#x2019;s turn to their main application in this course: infinite series. Where a sequence is an infinite <em>list</em> of numbers, a series is an infinite <em>sum</em>. Keep in mind the course roadmap: eventually, we&#x2019;ll want to add up not just numbers, but monomials, forming an object that&#x2019;s something like a polynomial with infinitely many terms. To start with, though, we&#x2019;ll stick to numbers only.

!begin-def
	
	series
	
	A <dfn>series</dfn> is a sum of the terms in a sequence $(a_n)$, written
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots.
	$$
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	The zig-zag shape is the Greek letter Sigma &mdash; S for sum. The expressions above and below it don&#x2019;t always have to be $n = 1$ and $\infty$: the bottom expression indicates the index variable (here, that&#x2019;s $n$) and the first value it should take (1), and the top number is the last value it should take (here, the $\infty$ means to keep going and never stop). Let&#x2019;s look at some examples of series to get a sense of how they can differ.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	series
	
	Evaluate the following sums.
	
	1. $\sum_{n = 1}^5 n$.
	
	2. $\sum_{i = -2}^2 \frac{1}{i^2 + 1}$.
	
	3. $\sum_{k = 0}^\infty 2$.
	
	1. Expanding out the first sum, we have
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^5 n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
	$$
	
	If you&#x2019;ve done any programming before, series look a whole lot like for loops. If you get into coding in the future, for loops will look a lot like series. The idea is very similar to a sequence, except that we don&#x2019;t just write out all the terms &mdash; we add them up, one by one.
	
	2. This time, the index variable is $i$, not $n$. We start it at $-2$, increase it by $1$ until it hits $2$, and add up every term we get along the way. That comes out to
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i = -2}^2 \frac{1}{i^2 + 1} &= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5}\\
			&= \frac{12}{5}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	3. This one is a little weird. Our index variable is $k$, but it doesn&#x2019;t appear anywhere in the terms we&#x2019;re adding up. Instead, we&#x2019;re supposed to just add up a bunch of $2$s as $k$ increases. Since there are infinitely many values for $k$ to take, there are infinitely many $2$s to add up. So we get
	
	$$
		\sum_{k = 0}^\infty 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + \cdots.
	$$
	
	It&#x2019;s pretty clear that this won&#x2019;t have any meaningful value, but we don&#x2019;t yet have the language to describe how or why. With that in mind, let&#x2019;s talk about what it means for a series to converge.
	
!end-example



!begin-def
	
	partial sums
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be an infinite series. The <dfn>$k$th partial sum</dfn>, written $S_k$, is defined as
	
	$$
		S_k = \sum_{n = 1}^k a_n.
	$$
	
	In other words, the $k$th partial sum of a series is obtained by adding up its first $k$ terms.
	
!end-def



!begin-exercise
	
	partial sums
	
	For each of the following series, write out the first five terms. Then find the first, third, and fifth partial sums.
	
	1. $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n$.
	
	2. $\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m}$.
	
	3. $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{2}{3^k}$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	It&#x2019;s common to confuse the terms of a series with its partial sums &mdash; hopefully this helps disambiguate them. The purpose of partial sums is to let us talk about the convergence of series. The behavior of the terms turns out not to be particularly helpful: if we want to assign a value to $\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{m}$, then knowing that $\left( \frac{1}{m} \right) \to 0$ doesn&#x2019;t tell us much. In fact, if we&#x2019;re adding up infinitely many positive things, those things had better converge to zero &mdash; if they don&#x2019;t, there&#x2019;s no chance the sum will be finite. What we want is the limit of a sequence that gives better and better approximations of the infinite sum, and that&#x2019;s exactly what the sequence of partial sums does.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	convergence of series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be an infinite series. If the sequence $(S_k)$ of partial sums converges to a limit $S$, then we say that the series converges to $S$, and write
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = S.
	$$
	
	If $(S_k)$ diverges, then we say that the series diverges.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	convergence of a series
	
	Evaluate $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}$ or show it diverges.
	
	We start by finding the partial sums. The first few are
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			S_1 &= \frac{1}{2}\\
			S_2 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\\
			S_3 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\\
			S_4 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16}\\
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Every term is half of the previous and also half of what&#x2019;s needed to reach $1$. Therefore, $(S_k) \to 1$, and so
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = 1.
	$$
	
	It can be a little counterintuitive that adding up infinitely many numbers, even if they&#x2019;re getting smaller, can ever result in something finite. Conveniently, this sum in particular has a famous visualization that can make it much easier to digest. Begin with a square of side length $1$ and divide it into two equal rectangles of area $\frac{1}{2}$. Shade one and divide the other into two equal squares of area $\frac{1}{4}$. Shade one, divide the other, and repeat. As the number of divisions gets larger and larger, the unshaded area vanishes to zero, and the total area approaches $1$.

!begin-exercise
	
	convergence of series
	
	Evaluate the following series or show they don&#x2019;t converge.
	
	1. $\sum_{i = 0}^\infty (-1)^i$.
	
	2. $\sum_{m = 1}^\infty \frac{2}{3^m}$.
	
	3. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$. Note: this is called the <dfn>Harmonic series</dfn>, and is quite famous. To get a handle on its behavior, try grouping the terms in this manner: put the first and second terms by themselves, then put the third and fourth together, then the fifth through the eighth together, then the 9th through the 16th, and so on, doubling the size of each group.
