	As we&#x2019;ve mentioned many times by now, this course revolves around series. The later sections will be devoted to Taylor series, the application we care most about, but we have an important question we need to address before then: how do we know if a series will converge? Unfortunately, the answer turns out to be substantially more complicated than we&#x2019;d like, similarly to the question of <em>how do we integrate functions</em> that you spent a whole quarter answering in calculus II. That answer took the form of a handful of piecemeal integration strategies that operated very differently from one another and could only address certain kinds of integrals. In much the same way, our answer to the question of convergence will be a collection of different strategies that handle many situations, but not all. We&#x2019;ll start with the simplest in this section and work our way up from there.

!text s The Divergence Test

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Take a convergent series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ and its sequence of partial sums $(S_k)$. We can write any term $a_n$ as $a_n = S_n - S_{n - 1}$, as long as $n \geq 2$, since the difference between $S_{n - 1}$ and $S_n$ is that the latter includes $a_n$ while the former doesn&#x2019;t. Since we assumed the series converges, we know that $(S_n) \to S$ for some $S$. Therefore, we can take the limit of both sides of the relation between $a_n$ and $S_n$ and get a meaningful answer:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			a_n &= S_n - S_{n - 1}\\
			\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n - \lim_{n \to \infty} S_{n - 1}\\
			\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= S - S\\
			\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= 0.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Taking the limit of $S_{n - 1}$ might feel a little strange, but as $n$ approaches $\infty$, so does $n - 1$, so $S_{n - 1}$ approaches the same thing that $S_n$ does.
	
	What we&#x2019;ve shown here is that <strong>every</strong> convergent series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ must satisfy $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$. So if that limit either doesn&#x2019;t exist or isn&#x2019;t zero, there&#x2019;s no way the series can converge. This is the content of our first test:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	the divergence test
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be a series. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ does not exist or is nonzero, then $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	There are two important things to note here: first, the divergence test says nothing about when series <strong>do</strong> converge. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$, the series might still diverge: for example, $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \to 0$, but $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ diverges. The other important point is that the divergence test provides no information on the <strong>value</strong> of series, divergent or not. Much like sequences, a series can diverge because its partial sums approach infinity, or simply because they never settle down to one particular value, as we saw in an example in the last section. The divergence test is just the first and easiest test to tell if a series clearly diverges, without having to do a lot of work.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-exercise
	
	the divergence test
	
	Apply the divergence test to the following series and clearly state what conclusion you can draw.
	
	1. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$.
	
	2. $\sum_{j = 2}^\infty \ln(j)$.
	
	3. $\sum_{i = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{i + 1} \cos(i)$.

!text s The Integral Test

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	There&#x2019;s a good chance you&#x2019;d already seen series before this course: Riemann sums are usually introduced in calculus II in order to define integration. By now, we have a robust theory of integration that doesn&#x2019;t require resorting to Riemann sums every time we need to take an integral, and so we can turn things around, using integrals to tell us about the convergence of sums.
	
	As a brief refresher, Riemann sums are an approximation of the area under a curve. Given a function $f$ on an interval $[a, b]$, we choose a width $\Delta x$ and divide $[a, b]$ into pieces of size $\Delta x$. Every piece forms the base of a rectangle whose height is determined by the value of $f$ at some point in the interval.
	
	!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q3ovooxz7u
	
	Let&#x2019;s fix $\Delta x = 1$, so that every rectangle&#x2019;s area is equal to its height. Rather than thinking of that Riemann sum as an approximation of the integral, we can treat the integral as an approximation of the sum. Sure, it&#x2019;s not a great approximation, but if all we care about is whether the sum is infinite or not, it will be good enough.
	
	We&#x2019;ll need a few restrictions on the series to make this work properly. Let&#x2019;s look at an example where everything works well, and then we&#x2019;ll back up and see what properties were necessary.
	
	Let $a_n = \frac{1}{n + 4}$ and consider the series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \cdots.
	$$
	
	We know from last section that this series diverges &mdash; sure, it&#x2019;s not exactly equal to the harmonic series, since it&#x2019;s missing the first four terms, but when we&#x2019;re only deciding whether a series converges or not, and not the exact value it converges <em>to</em>, we can always remove any number of terms from the start without changing the answer. Terms in a series are finite, so in our case, knowing that the whole series diverges to $\infty$ means that the infinite &#x201C;tail end&#x201D; is always infinitely large, no matter where we consider the start of the tail. Here, the start is at $\frac{1}{5}$.
	
	Our goal is to find a function whose integral is approximated by a Riemann sum that looks roughly like $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}$. As we mentioned, if we take $\Delta x = 1$, then the terms in a Riemann sum are exactly function values. Therefore, we can just take $f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 4}$.
	
	You may remember from calc 2 that a Riemann sum is allowed to sample its function value from anywhere in the intervals. Two particular kinds of Riemann sums are called <dfn>left</dfn> and <dfn>right Riemann sums</dfn>, named for the way they choose the point to sample: either the left or the right endpoint of each interval.
	
	!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7coatmahvu
	
	Here the function $f(x)$ is shown in purple, the rectangles of a left Riemann sum on $[1, \infty)$ in blue, and the rectangles of a right Riemann sum on $[0, \infty)$ in red. Here&#x2019;s the crucial takeaway: Since $\frac{1}{x + 4}$ is a decreasing function for $x \geq 0$, the left endpoint of every interval is where $f$ reaches its maximum on that interval, and the right endpoint where it reaches its minimum. Therefore, the blue rectangles are always above the graph of the function, and the red rectangles are always below. But because of the way the two Riemann sums are staggered, with the blue startng at $x = 1$ and the red at $x = 0$, they both have exactly the same total area &mash; namely,
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}.
	$$
	
	Since the blue rectangles are always an overapproximation of the actual area, we have that
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \geq \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx.
	$$
	
	Similarly, since the red rectangles are always an underapproximation,
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \leq \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx.
	$$
	
	We&#x2019;ve succeeded in relating the Riemann sums to an integral, and the fact that the two inequalities go in different directions is the best part. If $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx$ is finite, then our sum must be too, because of the second inequality. On the other hand, if $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx = \infty$, then the same must be true of $\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx$, since we&#x2019;re only adding area. By the first inequality above, our sum must diverge. Therefore, whether the sum converges or diverges, <strong>the integral does the same thing</strong>. It may not converge to the same value, but this is still an excellent piece of information.
	
	Let&#x2019;s close out this example by actually evaluating the integral, and then we&#x2019;ll state the general result.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\ dx &= \left. \left[ \ln |x + 4| \right] \right|_1^\infty\\
			&= \lim_{b \to \infty} (\ln |b + 4| - \ln |1 + 4|)\\
			&= \lim_{b \to \infty} (\ln (b + 4) - \ln(5)), \text{ since } b > 0\\
			&= \infty.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, the integral diverges, and so we also have that the sum $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}$ diverges too.
	
	Okay, so what properties did $\frac{1}{n + 4}$ have that we needed? Crucial to the argument was the fact that $\frac{1}{x + 4}$ is decreasing and integrable on $[1, \infty)$. Beyond that, we didn&#x2019;t need any other properties, and so the statement of this result for general series requires only those two facts.

!begin-thm

	the integral test
	
	Let $\sum_{n = N}^\infty a_n$ be a series, and let $f(x)$ be a function on $[N, \infty)$ such that
	
	1. $f(x)$ is decreasing.
	
	2. $f(x)$ is integrable.
	
	3. $f(n) = a_n$ for every integer $n \geq N$.
	
	Then $\sum_{n = N}^\infty a_n$ and $\int_N^\infty f(x)\ dx$ either both converge or both diverge.
