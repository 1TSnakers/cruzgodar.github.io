	We&#x2019;ll take a brief diversion from general convergence tests to talk about a particular kind of series that will come up frequently in the second half of the course. While most of the series we&#x2019;ve considered before have had only positive entries, we&#x2019;ll now allow some entries to be negative &mdash; but to keep things relatively well-behaved, we&#x2019;ll require a strict pattern for <em>which</em> entries are negative.

	alternating series
	
	An <dfn>alternating series</dfn> is one of the form
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n + 1} a_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \cdots
	$$
	
	or
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^n a_n = -a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - \cdots,
	$$
	
	where every $a_n \geq 0$.

	Alternating series are well-named: the terms alternate in sign. This can have some profoud effects on the behavior of the series. For example, one of the most famous alternating series is the <dfn>Alternating Harmonic series</dfn>, defined as
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots.
	$$
	
	While the standard Harmonic series diverges, the alternating version converges &mdash; in fact, it converges to a rather surprising number. Later in the course, we&#x2019;ll have a very slick way to find that number, but we can bootstrap it right now with a geometric argument.

	Here, we have the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ graphed on the interval $[1, 2]$. We&#x2019;re going to construct a left Riemann sum in a rather strange way. We&#x2019;ll start with a single rectangle, which is a square with area $1$. Rather than jumping straight to two rectangles, our next step (set $n = 2$ to see it) is to prepare the way for the second rectangle by removing the entire right half of the square. The total area is the $1$ we started with, minus the $\frac{1}{2}$ we just removed. Now we&#x2019;ll actually add in the next rectangle. It&#x2019;s built on $\left[ \frac{3}{2}, 2 \right]$, and this is a left Riemann sum, so since $f \left( \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{2}{3}$, that&#x2019;s our height. The total area is therefore $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$, and so our total area is now
	
	$$
		1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}.
	$$
	
	Now we&#x2019;ll repeat this process on both of these rectangles, removing the right half and adding back in whatever rectangle is actually supposed to be there. In this next step, we remove rectangles of area $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{6}$, and in their places, we add rectangles of area $\frac{1}{4} \cdot f \left( \frac{5}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{4} \cdot f \left( \frac{7}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{7}$, resulting in a total area of
	
	$$
		1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7}.
	$$
	
	As the number of rectangles limits to $\infty$, our sum approaches the Alternating Harmonic series. But it&#x2019;s also a Riemann sum, approaching
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x}\ dx = \left. \left[ \ln |x| \right] \right|_1^2 = \ln(2).
	$$
	
	Rather shockingly, the Alternating Harmonic series converges to $\ln(2)$!
	
	If we don&#x2019;t care about the value, it&#x2019;s not hard to see that this series converges. Every term is less in absolute value than the last, so anything we subtract is always less than the last thing we added. Similarly, anything we add is less than the last thing we subtracted. The result is a series that is constantly doubling back on itself, but with less distance every time, and so it must eventually converge. Drag $M$ to increase the terms of the sequence &mdash; the intersections with the $x$-axis are the partial sums.
