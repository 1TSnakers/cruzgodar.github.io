!begin-text-block

	Our final two tests for convergence have the nice effect of applying to series with positive and negative terms alike. They&#x2019;re simple to state and apply, and together with the previous five tests, they round out a solid theory of convergence.
	
	The Harmonic series diverges because even though its terms shrink to zero, they don&#x2019;t do so fast enough. So far, we haven&#x2019;t had a way to measure what &#x201C;fast enough&#x201D; means exactly, but our final two tests will each provide a possible interpretation. One idea we might pursue is looking at the size of terms not only in an absolute sense, but relative to each other as well. For example, when $n$ is very large, the two successive terms $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ in the Harmonic series are very nearly the same size. The ratio between them is
	
	$$
		\frac{\frac{1}{n + 1}}{\frac{1}{n}} = \frac{n + 1}{n} \to 1
	$$
	
	as $n \to \infty$. On the other hand, something like the geometric series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}$ has a ratio of successive terms equal to
	
	$$
		\frac{\frac{1}{2^{n + 1}}}{\frac{1}{2^n}} = \frac{2^n}{2^{n + 1}} = \frac{1}{2}.
	$$
	
	In other words, not only are the terms of that geometric series getting smaller in an absolute sense (i.e. approaching zero), they&#x2019;re also shrinking relative to each other, whereas the terms of the Harmonic series are not consistently smaller relative to each other for large $n$. This idea of quantifying the ratio between successive terms is the centeral mechanic of our first test.

!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	the ratio test
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be a series and define a value $r$ by
	
	$$
		r = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n} \right|.
	$$
	
	If $0 \leq r < 1$, then the series converges. If $r > 1$, the series diverges. If $r = 1$, the test is inconclusive.

!end-thm



!begin-text-block

	It&#x2019;s worth briefly justifying why the ratio test works. If $r > 1$, then eventually every term is larger than the previous, so the divergence test tells us the series must diverge. If $r < 1$, then there is some number $s$ with $r < s < 1$ so that for large enough $n$ (say all $n \geq N$), $a_{n + 1} < s a_n$. Then $a_{n + 2} < s a_{n + 1} < s^2 a_n$, and so on. This looks a whole lot like a geometric series, and what we end up with is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n &= \sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1} a_n + \sum_{n = N}^\infty a_n\\
			&< \sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1} a_n + a_N \sum_{n = 0}^\infty s^n\\
			&= \sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1} a_n + a_N \cdot \frac{1}{1 - s},
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	which is finite. This is a bit grittier than our justifications usually are, and it&#x2019;s perfectly fine to engage with the ratio test at the level of just remembering the theorem statement. Under the hood, though, it&#x2019;s all just geometric series.
	
	Like every other test we know, the ratio test is incapable of determining what value a convergent series converges to. It can function on series with negative terms, though, making it fairly versatile.

!end-text-block



!begin-example

	the ratio test
	
	Determine if the series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{e^n}{n!}$ converges or diverges.
	
	As usual, we&#x2019;ll start with the divergence test. As $n \to \infty$, the behavior of $\frac{e^n}{n!}$ is a little complicated. Which grows faster: an exponential, or a factorial? Since the factorial function is defined only on positive integers, there&#x2019;s no equivalent function we know of on the real numbers that we can differentiate in order to apply L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule &mdash; we just have to reason this one out. Both $e^n$ and $n!$ are products of $n$ numbers: we have
	
	$$
		\frac{e^n}{n!} = \frac{e \cdot e \cdots e \cdot e}{n \cdot (n-1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1}.
	$$
	
	Whenever $n$ increases by $1$, the numerator is increased by a factor of $e$, while the denominator is increased by a factor of $n$. In total, that means multiplying by $\frac{e}{n}$, and since $n \to \infty$ and $e$ is a constant, we&#x2019;re multiplying by smaller and smaller numbers every time. In total, $\frac{e^n}{n!} \to 0$.
	
	Therefore, the divergence test is inconclusive. In general, the ratio test works best with series whose terms have lots of exponentials and/or factorials &mdash; this has plenty of both, so let&#x2019;s give it a shot. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{e^{n + 1}}{(n + 1)!}}{\frac{e^n}{n!}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(n!)(e^{n + 1})}{((n + 1)!)(e^n)} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(n!)(e)}{(n + 1)!} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{e \cdot n \cdot (n - 1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1}{(n + 1) \cdot n \cdot (n - 1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{e}{n + 1} \right|\\
			&= 0.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	By the ratio test, the series converges.

!end-example

!begin-exercise

	the ratio test
	
	Determine if the following series converge or diverge.
	
	1. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n n}{2^n}$.
	
	2. $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{(k!)^2}{(2k)!}$.
	
	<strong>Solutions:</strong>
	
	1. With all the exponentials, let&#x2019;s try the ratio test. We can also use the alternating series test, but the ratio test will work well enough for our purposes. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{(-1)^{n + 1} (n + 1)}{2^{n + 1}}}{\frac{(-1)^n n}{2^n}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1)^{n + 1} (n + 1) 2^n}{(-1)^n n 2^{n + 1}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1) (n + 1)}{2n} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1) (n + 1)}{2n} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n + 1}{2n}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Since $r < 1$, the series converges. As a side note, since we could just as well have taken an absolute value before applying the test and gotten the same result, it must converge absolutely.
	
	2. Whenever there are factorials, the ratio test is almost always the best option. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{((k + 1)!)^2}{(2(k+1))!}}{\frac{(k!)^2}{(2k)!}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{((k + 1)!)^2 (2k)!}{(k!)^2 (2k + 2)!} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{(k + 1)^2}{(2k + 2)(2k + 1)} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{4k^2 + 6k + 2} \right|\\
			&= \frac{1}{4}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Again, since $r < 1$, the series converges.

!end-exercise

!begin-exercise

	the ratio test
	
	Let&#x2019;s show that when $r = 1$ in the ratio test, we really can&#x2019;t determine anything about the series. Of the three following series, one is divergent, one is absolutely convergent, and one is conditionally convergent. Determine which is which, and then show that $r = 1$ for all three.
	
	1. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$.
	
	2. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n^2}$.
	
	3. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^n$.
	
	<strong>Solutions:</strong>
	
	1. This converges conditionally by the AST, but not absolutely, since removing the $(-1)^n$ makes it the Harmonic series, which diverges. The ratio test gives us
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{n + 1}}{\frac{(-1)^n}{n}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1)^{n + 1} n}{(-1)^n (n + 1)} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| - \frac{n}{n + 1} \right|\\
			&= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	2. This one converges absolutely, since stripping off the sign results in $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$, which is a $p$-series with $p = 2$ and therefore converges. Applying the ratio test, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{(n + 1)^2}}{\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1)^{n + 1} n^2}{(-1)^n (n + 1)^2} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| - \frac{n^2}{n^2 + 2n + 1} \right|\\
			&= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	3. Finally, this is just a divergent series, since it fails the divergence test. The ratio test is even simpler than the previous two:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{(-1)^n} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| -1 \right|\\
			&= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$

!text s The Root Test

<br>



!begin-text-block

	Much like the ratio test, the root test compares a given series to a geometric series. If the terms $a_n$ of a series satisfy $|a_n| \approx r^n$, then $\sqrt[n]{|a_n|} \approx r$. Just like the ratio test, we&#x2019;ll solidify that approximation by taking a limit.

!end-text-block

!begin-thm

	the root test
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be a series and define a value $r$ by
	
	$$
		r = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}.
	$$
	
	If $0 \leq r < 1$, then the series converges. If $r > 1$, the series diverges. If $r = 1$, the test is inconclusive.

!end-thm



!begin-example

	the root test

	Determine if the series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{\sin^n(n)}{n^n}$ converges or diverges.
	
	The root test works best when there are lots of expressions raised to the power of $n$ in the terms. Since $\sin^n(n)$ is just another way of writing $(\sin(n))^n$, the terms can be rewritten as
	
	$$
		\left( \frac{\sin(n)}{n} \right)^n.
	$$
	
	Then the root test asks us to find $r$, which is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{\left| \frac{\sin(n)}{n} \right|^n}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\sin(n)}{n} \right|\\
			&= 0.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, the series converges.

!end-example

!begin-exercise

	the root test

	Determine if the following series converge or diverge by using the root test.
	
	1. $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{2^k}{(k + 1)^k}$.
	
	2. $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{n}{2^n}$.
	
	<strong>Solutions:</strong>
	
	1. While we could try the ratio test here, the $(k + 1)^k$ will make that a bit of a nightmare &mdash; nothing will cancel. Instead, all of the powers of $k$ mean the root test is probably the right choice. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\left| \frac{2}{k + 1} \right|^k}\\
			&= \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{2}{k + 1}\\
			&= 0.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Since $r < 1$, the series converges.
	
	2. This time, there are definitely better choices than the root test: the limit comparison and ratio tests would both work well. But the root test isn&#x2019;t so bad: it gives
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{\left| \frac{n}{2^n} \right|}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{\frac{n}{2^n}}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt[n]{n}}{2}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^{1/n}}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Solving this limit is a little bit complicated: since there&#x2019;s an $n$ in both the base and exponent, we need to rewrite it with $\ln$.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \frac{1}{2} \lim_{n \to \infty} n^{1/n}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2} e^{\lim_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( n^{1/n} \right)}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2} e^{\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\ln \left( n \right)}{n}}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2} e^{\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1/n}{1}}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2} e^0\\
			&= \frac{1}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Since $r < 1$, the series converges.

!end-exercise



!begin-text-block

	As a final topic before we move on to series that can approximate functions in the next section, let&#x2019;s discuss how to choose a test for convergence. It&#x2019;s way too much to try all seven, and usually there are clues that one or two are favored over the others.
	
	Given a series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ with all positive terms, the easiest way to test convergence is if the series is a common, recognizable one, like a $p$-series or geometric series &mdash; if that&#x2019;s the case, then you already know the answer based on the parameter of the series. If it looks <em>like</em> a $p$-series or geometric series, but the terms are slightly modified by something you expect will be insignificant (e.g. a constant in one part of a fraction), try applying the comparison test. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, try the limit comparison test.
	
	Failing that, if it&#x2019;s easy to take the limit of the terms $a_n$ as $n \to \infty$, then try the divergence test. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, and the terms contain lots of exponentials or factorials, try the ratio or root test. Usually the root test is the better choice if there are only exponentials, and the ratio test is better if there are factorials anywhere. Finally, if all else fails, turn to the integral test.
	
	If your series contains negative terms, things work a little differently. If you care about absolute convergence, you need to consider the series of absolute values, which means you&#x2019;re back in the previous case. If you want to test for conditional convergence, you can use the alternating series test if the signs alternate, or the ratio or root tests if they don&#x2019;t (e.g. if $a_n = \sin(n)$).
	
	Finally, if you need to estimate the value of a series, you&#x2019;ll have to use the alternating series test if it&#x2019;s alternating and the integral test if it&#x2019;s not. None of the other tests we&#x2019;ve seen provide remainder estimates.
	
	Hopefully this helps! There will be plenty of opportunities to practice before the next section, when we move into the second half of the course.
