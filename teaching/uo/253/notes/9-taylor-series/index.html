	By now, we&#x2019;ve built up a robust theory of series. We know when and where they converge, and in a few special cases, we know what they converge to. In this section, we&#x2019;ll extend those few special cases to almost every power series we&#x2019;ve seen, and by the end, we&#x2019;ll be able to pass from functions to power series and back almost effortlessly.
	
	Let&#x2019;s return to an old friend: $\frac{1}{1 - x}$. We already know that when $|x| < 1$, it&#x2019;s equal to $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$, but the way we found that was by directly taking a limit of partial sums and expressing $1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k$ as $\frac{1 - x^{k + 1}}{1 - x}$. That method was specific to this particular series and doesn&#x2019;t really help with any others. Instead, let&#x2019;s try to find series like that in general, without any fancy tricks.
	
	Take a power series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n$ centered at $x = a$, and suppose that the series converges to a function $f(x)$ on some interval $(a - R, a + R)$. With the logic we used at the end of the previous section, we can extract the derivatives of $f$ from the coefficients of the series. Specifically, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(a) &= c_0\\
			f'(a) &= c_1\\
			f''(a) &= 2 \cdot c_2\\
			f'''(a) &= 3 \cdot 2 \cdot c_3\\
			f''''(a) &= 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot c_4\\
			& \ \ \vdots\\
			f^{(n)}(a) &= n!c_n.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	From this perspective, if we know a power series representation of a function $f$, then we can find any derivative of $f$ from the coefficients. But we really want to go the other way: we want to <em>find</em> series representations from a function. To get at that direction, let&#x2019;s solve all of those equations for the $c_n$:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			c_0 &= \frac{f^{(0)}(a)}{0!} = f(a)\\
			c_1 &= \frac{f^{(1)}(a)}{1!} = f'(a)\\
			c_2 &= \frac{f^{(2)}(a)}{2!} = \frac{f''(a)}{2}\\
			c_3 &= \frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!} = \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}\\
			c_0 &= \frac{f^{(4)}(a)}{4!}\\
			& \ \ \vdots\\
			c_n &= \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	What we&#x2019;ve come to is the idea that underpins the entire section, and to a large extent the course: if $f$ has a power series representation centered at $x = a$, then there is only one possibility for what it can be, since power series representations are unique, and we&#x2019;ve just written down what that one possibility is. We&#x2019;ll be talking quite a lot about these things, and they deserve their own name.

!begin-def

	Taylor series
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function that is infinitely differentiable. The <dfn>Taylor series</dfn> expansion of $f$ centered at $a$ is the power series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}}{n!} (x - a)^n.
	$$
	
	A Taylor series centered at $0$ is called a <dfn>Maclaurin series</dfn>. The partial sums of a Taylor or Maclaurin series are called the <dfn>Taylor</dfn> or <dfn>Maclaurin polynomials</dfn> for $f$ centered at $a$.
