!begin-text-block

	When series only contained numbers, we just had to understand them to the extent of determining whether they converged or not. Now that the terms have variables in them &mdash; in particular, different powers in each term, so that nothing can be combined &mdash; we need to be more comfortable dealing with series as objects in their own right, and not just unresolved sums that may or may not converge.

!text s Adding Power Series

<br>

	

!begin-text-block
	
	The first and simplest thing we can do to power series is to add two of them together. Thankfully, this works as well as we could hope.

!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	adding power series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$ be two power series that converge to the functions $f$ and $g$ on the intervals $I$ and $J$, respectively. Then the power series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (a_n + b_n) x^n
	$$
	
	converges to $f + g$ on the overlap of $I$ and $J$.

!end-prop



!begin-example

	adding power series
	
	Express the function
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)}
	$$
	
	as a power series and determine the interval of convergence.
	
	While we can express this as two series multiplied together, we don&#x2019;t really know how to handle that kind of construction yet. Instead, let&#x2019;s turn to an old friend: partial fractions. That will let us write $f$ as the sum of two much simpler power series that we understand well, and then we can combine them using the previous proposition.
	
	Partial fractions tells us that for some numbers $A$ and $B$,
	
	$$
		\frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)} = \frac{A}{1 - 2x} + \frac{Bx + C}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	In other words,
	
	$$
		5 = A(1 + x^2) + (Bx + C)(1 - 2x) = (A + C) + (B - 2C)x + (A - 2B)x^2.
	$$
	
	We then separate this into three equations by equating the coefficients.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			5 &= A + C\\
			0 &= B - 2C\\
			0 &= A - 2B.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Working this out, we wind up with
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			A &= 4\\
			B &= 2\\
			C &= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, our expansion of the series $f$ becomes
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	Now all three of these terms have geometric series representations &mdash; we looked at many like them in the last section. First of all,
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 - 2x} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2x)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n),
	$$
	
	which converges when $|2x| < 1$, so $|x| < \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.
	
	For the other denominator, we have
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-x^2)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}).
	$$
	
	This series converges when $|-x^2| < 1$, so $|x| < 1$. The interval of convergence is therefore $(-1, 1)$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s put it all together. The sum of all three terms becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\\
			&= 4\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n) + 2x\sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}) + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n})\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (4 \cdot 2^n x^n + 2 \cdot (-1)^n x^{2n + 1} + (-1)^n x^{2n}).
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The two intervals of convergence are $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$ and $(-1, 1)$, and the overlap of those two is just the first one &mdash; therefore, the interval of convergence of our very complicated series is just $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.

!end-example



!begin-exercise

	adding power series
	
	Express the function
	
	$$
		g(x) = \frac{6}{(1 - x)(2 - x)(3 - x)}
	$$
	
	as a power series and determine the interval of convergence.

!end-exercise



!begin-text-block

	For many series, we now have the tools to go backward: determine the function it&#x2019;s converging to given just the series.

!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	finding a closed form of a series
	
	Define a function $f$ by
	
	$$
		f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty 2^{-2n}x^n.
	$$
	
	Find a closed form for $f$ (i.e. a form without an infinite series).
	
	This looks a bit like a geometric series, but to apply the formula, we need every term to be raised to the power of $n$, not $-2n$. To that end, let&#x2019;s rewrite $2^{-2n}$ as $4^{-n} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n$, so that the series becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^n x^n\\
			&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^n.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now this is very close to a geometric series, but it&#x2019;s starting at $n = 1$ instead of $n = 0$. To remedy that, we&#x2019;ll start it at $0$ and then remove the first term later.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= -\left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^0 + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^n\\
			&= -1 + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x}{4}}\\
			&= -1 + \frac{1}{\frac{4 - x}{4}}\\
			&= -1 + \frac{4}{4 - x}\\
			&= \frac{x}{4 - x}.
		\end{align*}
	$$

!text s Multiplying Power Series

<br>



!begin-text-block

	The process of adding power series closely mirrors adding polynomials: we just add the coefficients of like terms. Multiplying polynomials is a much more complicated process, though, and multiplying power series will take some extra work to pin down too. Let&#x2019;s start with a motivating example and see what we can determine.
	
	Let $f(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2$ and $g(x) = 4 + 5x + 6x^2$. We normally write polynomials in descending order of their terms&#x2019; exponents, but this reverse order matches how power series are structured &mdash; low exponents come first.
	
	What is $f(x)g(x)$? We typically find this by foiling out the terms, but the end result is that every term of $f$ gets multiplied with every term of $g$, resulting in 9 terms total. Let&#x2019;s arrange that in a table.
	
	$$
		\begin{array}{r|ccc}
			& 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			\hline
			1 & 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			2x & 8x & 10x^2 & 12x^3\\
			3x^2 & 12x^2 & 15x^3 & 18x^4
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	The product $fg$ is just the sum of all nine entries in the table, but there&#x2019;s a cleaner way to think of it that comes from the diagonals running from the bottom-left to the top-right.
	
	$$
		\definecolor{textred}{rgb}{.8, 0, 0}
		\definecolor{textyellow}{rgb}{.8, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textgreen}{rgb}{0, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textcyan}{rgb}{0, .6, 1}
		\definecolor{textblue}{rgb}{0, 0, 1}
		
		\begin{array}{r|ccc}
			& 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			\hline
			1 & {\color{textred} 4} & {\color{textyellow} 5x} & {\color{textgreen} 6x^2}\\
			2x & {\color{textyellow} 8x} & {\color{textgreen} 10x^2} & {\color{textcyan} 12x^3}\\
			3x^2 & {\color{textgreen} 12x^2} & {\color{textcyan} 15x^3} & {\color{textblue} 18x^4}
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	The key observation is that those diagonals (represented here as different colors) correspond to different exponents on $x$: for example, the green diagonal in the middle contains every $x^2$ term. Therefore, if we want to know the coefficient on $x^2$ in $f(x)g(x)$, we just need to add up those three.
	
	Let&#x2019;s make the jump from polynomials to series. If $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $g(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$, then the product $f(x)g(x)$ will be the sum of an infinite table:
	
	$$
		\definecolor{textred}{rgb}{.8, 0, 0}
		\definecolor{textyellow}{rgb}{.8, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textgreen}{rgb}{0, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textcyan}{rgb}{0, .6, 1}
		\definecolor{textblue}{rgb}{0, 0, 1}
		\definecolor{textmagenta}{rgb}{.8, 0, 1}
		
		\begin{array}{r|ccccccc}
			& b_0 & b_1 x & b_2 x^2 & b_3 x^3 & b_4 x^4 & b_5 x^5 & \cdots\\
			\hline
			a_0 & {\color{textred} a_0 b_0} & {\color{textyellow} a_0 b_1 x} & {\color{textgreen} a_0 b_2 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_0 b_3 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_0 b_4 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_0 b_5 x^5} & \ddots\\
			a_1 x & {\color{textyellow} a_1 b_0 x} & {\color{textgreen} a_1 b_1 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_1 b_2 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_1 b_3 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_1 b_4 x^5} & \ddots\\
			a_2 x^2 & {\color{textgreen} a_2 b_0 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_2 b_1 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_2 b_2 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_2 b_3 x^5} & \ddots\\
			a_3 x^3 & {\color{textcyan} a_3 b_0 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_3 b_1 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_3 b_2 x^5} & \ddots\\
			a_4 x^4 & {\color{textblue} a_4 b_0 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_4 b_1 x^5} & \ddots\\
			a_5 x^5 & {\color{textmagenta} a_5 b_0 x^5} & \ddots\\
			\vdots & \ddots
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	To extract the coefficient of $x^n$ in $fg$, we need to sum the $n$th diagonal. Now all of the terms $a_n x^n$ and $b_n x^n$ have the convenient property that their coefficients&#x2019; subscripts match the exponent on $x$, and multiplying two terms together makes the exponents add together. Therefore, the terms in the $n$th diagonal of our infinite table are the products of terms whose subscripts add to $n$. For instance, the sum of the $n = 3$ (i.e. green) diagonal is
	
	$$
		(a_0 b_3 + a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 + a_3 b_0) x^3,
	$$
	
	which are the four pairs of coefficients whose subscripts sum to $3$. To express that symbolically, the subscript on $a$ runs from $0$ to $3$, and if that subscript is $k$, then the subscript on $b$ must be $3 - k$, since they have to sum to $3$. In general, the final term becomes
	
	$$
		\left( \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k} \right) x^n.
	$$
	
	This is the main result about multiplying power series &mdash; all that&#x2019;s left is determining the interval of convergence.

!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	multiplying power series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$ be two power series that converge to the functions $f$ and $g$ on the intervals $I$ and $J$, respectively. Then the power series
	
	$$
		\left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n \right) \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n \right) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k} \right) x^n
	$$
	
	converges to $f + g$ on the overlap of $I$ and $J$.

	This is just the series for $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ multiplied by itself. Since all the coefficients are $1$, the product is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \sum_{k = 0}^n 1 \cdot 1 \right) x^n\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (n + 1) x^n\\
			&= 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots.
		\end{align*}
	$$

!text s Calculus on Power Series

<br>



!begin-text-block

	Now that we understand how basic algebraic operations work with power series, the natural next step is to ask how we do calculus with them: how do we differentiate and integrate? This is part of the magic of power series: they&#x2019;re just as easy to work with as polynomials, even though they&#x2019;re limits of partial sums behind the scenes. Both derivatives and integrals commute with those limits for reasons substantially more complicated than we have time to discuss in this course, and the end result is incredibly simple.

!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	calculus on power series
	
	Let $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n$ be a power series converging on $(a - R, a + R)$. Then $f$ is differentiable and integrable on $(a - R, a + R)$, and
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f'(x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{d}{dx} \left[ c_n (x - a)^n \right] = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty n c_n (x - a)^{n - 1}\\
			\int f(x)\ dx &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int c_n (x - a)^n\ dx = C + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n \frac{(x - a)^{n + 1}}{n + 1}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Importantly, this theorem does not mention the endpoints of the interval of convergence. If $f(x)$ converges there, its derivative and integral may too, or they may not.

!end-thm



!begin-example

	calculus on power series
	
	Find a power series representation for $\ln(x + 1)$ and state the interval of convergence.
	
	Since we really only know the series $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ at the moment, let&#x2019;s try to work with that. The connection to $\ln(x + 1)$ is that
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{1 + x}\ dx = \ln(1 + x) + C,
	$$
	
	so we want to replace $x$ with $-x$ in $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ and integrate the series term-by-term. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\ln(1 + x) &= \int \frac{1}{1 - (-x)}\ dx + C\\
			&= \int \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-x)^n\right)\ dx + C\\
			&= C + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int (-x)^n\ dx\\
			&= C + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int (-1)^n x^n\ dx\\
			&= C + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \int x^n\ dx\\
			&= C + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1}\\
			&= C + x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now leaving the constant $C$ in our answer is fine if we&#x2019;re asked to take the integral of some random function, but in this situation, we know that our answer is equal to $\ln(1 + x)$: it&#x2019;s only true for <em>one</em> value of $C$, not any. How can we figure it out? Well, $C$ is the only term of the series without an $x$, so if we plug in $x = 0$, we&#x2019;ll figure out what $C$ should be.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\ln(1 + 0) &= C + 0 - \frac{0^2}{2} + \frac{0^3}{3} - \cdots\\
			0 &= C.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, we can now say that a series representation for $\ln(1 + x)$ is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\ln(1 + x) &= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1}\\
			&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n + 1} \frac{x^n}{n}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	We started with $\frac{1}{1 - x}$, which has an interval of convergence of $(-1, 1)$. Replacing $x$ with $-x$ flips that horizontally, which results in the same interval. Then we integrate, which doesn&#x2019;t change the interval, so we still have $(-1, 1)$ at the end. What about the endpoints? The original series doesn&#x2019;t converge at $1$ or $-1$, but as the theorem mentioned, that doesn&#x2019;t provide any information about what this series does. At $x = -1$, all of the terms become negative, and we wind up with
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty -\frac{1}{n}.
	$$
	
	That&#x2019;s just the Harmonic series with a minus sign in front of it, so it diverges. On the other hand, plugging in $x = 1$ gives us
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n + 1} \frac{1}{n}.
	$$
	
	In contrast, this is the <em>Alternating</em> Harmonic series, which does converge, and so the interval of convergence is $(-1, 1]$. This is an especially good example, since it slots beautifully into our existing theory of series: we know the Alternating Harmonic series converges to $\ln(2)$, and this example verifies that in a different way. When we plugged $x = 1$ into the series, the other side of the equation became $\ln(1 + 1) = \ln(2)$.

!end-example

!begin-exercise

	calculus on power series
	
	We expressed
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}
	$$
	
	as a power series earlier by multiplying the series for $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ by itself. Find it a different way by starting from $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ and using calculus, and make sure the interval of convergence matches.

!end-exercise



!begin-text-block

	Let&#x2019;s look at one more nice property of power series: for the most part, they&#x2019;re all absolutely convergent, except possibly at the endpoints of the interval of convergence.

!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	absolute convergence of power series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n$ be a power series converging on $(a - R, a + R)$. Then the series converges absolutely on that interval.

!end-thm



!begin-text-block

	Again, this refers only to open intervals: if a series converges at the endpoint $a + R$, the convergence may be either conditional or absolute. In the case of the Alternating Harmonic series, it&#x2019;s right on the edge. We&#x2019;ve seen that it converges conditionally, but moving inward any amount causes the convergence to become absolute.
	
	One final result of this section is that we can confirm that power series representations of functions are unique: there can&#x2019;t be two different ways to represent one function as a power series if the interval of convergence matches. Suppose some function $f$ had two representations:
	
	$$
		f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty d_n (x - a)^n.
	$$
	
	By plugging in $x = a$ like in the last example (where $a$ was $0$), we have $f(a) = c_0 = d_0$, so the constant terms agree. Similarly, $f'(a) = c_1 = d_1$, since the constant terms vanish in the derivative. Now we know the first two terms match, and this process continues: $f''(a) = 2c_2 = 2d_2$, and so on. Any function expressible as a power series is differentiable and results in another power series which must itself be differentiable, and so <strong>every power series is infinitely differentiable!</strong> That means we can continue this process forever, and so the series must completely agree. We assumed that the two representations were centered at the same point $a$, and that&#x2019;s a necessary assumption: in the future, we&#x2019;ll see multiple different series representations of a function that differ by where they&#x2019;re centered. What we learned here is that for a given center, there&#x2019;s only one power series representation.
	
	So far, we&#x2019;ve got a good handle on how power series work and interact, and we even know representations of a few common functions. In the next section &mdash; the most important in the course &mdash; we&#x2019;ll extend the library of functions we can represent as power series to almost every function we&#x2019;ve ever seen, finally achieving the goal we layed out in the first section.

!end-text-block



!begin-exercise

	expressing $e^x$ as a power series
	
	We know that $e^x$ has the special property of being the only function (other than constant multiples of $e^x$) which is its own derivative. We can represent $e^x$ as a power series by finding a power series which is <em>its</em> own derivative. Begin with a general power series
	
	$$
		c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + c_3x^3 + \cdots
	$$
	
	and set it equal to its derivative to solve for the coefficients.
