Multiplying polynomials is a much more complicated process, though, and multiplying power series will take some extra work to pin down too. Let&#x2019;s start with a motivating example and see what we can determine.</p><br><p class="body-text">Let $f(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2$ and $g(x) = 4 + 5x + 6x^2$. We normally write polynomials in descending order of their terms&#x2019; exponents, but this reverse order matches how power series are structured &mdash; low exponents come first.</p><br><p class="body-text">What is $f(x)g(x)$? We typically find this by foiling out the terms, but the end result is that every term of $f$ gets multiplied with every term of $g$, resulting in 9 terms total.

If $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $g(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$, then the product $f(x)g(x)$ will be the sum of an infinite table:</p><p class="body-text">$$\definecolor{textred}{rgb}{.8, 0, 0}\definecolor{textyellow}{rgb}{.8, .6, 0}\definecolor{textgreen}{rgb}{0, .6, 0}\definecolor{textcyan}{rgb}{0, .6, 1}\definecolor{textblue}{rgb}{0, 0, 1}\definecolor{textmagenta}{rgb}{.8, 0, 1}\begin{array}{r|ccccccc}& b_0 & b_1 x & b_2 x^2 & b_3 x^3 & b_4 x^4 & b_5 x^5 & \cdots\\\hlinea_0 & {\color{textred} a_0 b_0} & {\color{textyellow} a_0 b_1 x} & {\color{textgreen} a_0 b_2 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_0 b_3 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_0 b_4 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_0 b_5 x^5} & \ddots\\a_1 x & {\color{textyellow} a_1 b_0 x} & {\color{textgreen} a_1 b_1 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_1 b_2 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_1 b_3 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_1 b_4 x^5} & \ddots\\a_2 x^2 & {\color{textgreen} a_2 b_0 x^2} & {\color{textcyan} a_2 b_1 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_2 b_2 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_2 b_3 x^5} & \ddots\\a_3 x^3 & {\color{textcyan} a_3 b_0 x^3} & {\color{textblue} a_3 b_1 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_3 b_2 x^5} & \ddots\\a_4 x^4 & {\color{textblue} a_4 b_0 x^4} & {\color{textmagenta} a_4 b_1 x^5} & \ddots\\a_5 x^5 & {\color{textmagenta} a_5 b_0 x^5} & \ddots\\\vdots & \ddots\end{array}$$</p><p class="body-text">To extract the coefficient of $x^n$ in $fg$, we need to sum the $n$th diagonal. Now all of the terms $a_n x^n$ and $b_n x^n$ have the convenient property that their coefficients&#x2019; subscripts match the exponent on $x$, and multiplying two terms together makes the exponents add together. Therefore, the terms in the $n$th diagonal of our infinite table are the products of terms whose subscripts add to $n$. For instance, the sum of the $n = 3$ (i.e. green) diagonal is</p><p class="body-text">$$(a_0 b_3 + a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 + a_3 b_0) x^3,$$</p><p class="body-text">which are the four pairs of coefficients whose subscripts sum to $3$. To express that symbolically, the subscript on $a$ runs from $0$ to $3$, and if that subscript is $k$, then the subscript on $b$ must be $3 - k$, since they have to sum to $3$.

This is an especially good example, since it slots beautifully into our existing theory of series: we know the Alternating Harmonic series converges to $\ln(2)$, and this example verifies that in a different way. When we plugged $x = 1$ into the series, the other side of the equation became $\ln(1 + 1) = \ln(2)$.</p><br></div><div class="notes-exercise notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-exercise-title">Exercise: calculus on power series</span></p><br><p class="body-text">We expressed</p><p class="body-text">$$\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}$$</p><p class="body-text">as a power series earlier by multiplying the series for $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ by itself. Find it a different way by starting from $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ and using calculus, and make sure the interval of convergence matches.</p><br><p class="body-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> In order to make $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ look like $\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}$ through calculus, we need to differentiate it. If $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x}$, then $f'(x) = \frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}$, since the minus sign from bringing down the power of $-1$ cancels with the minus sign from the chain rule. So in order to find a series representation for $f'$, we need to differentiate the series for $f$ term-by-term. That results in</p><p class="body-text">$$f'(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty nx^{n - 1} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots.$$</p><p class="body-text">We know from before that the interval of convergence should be $(-1, 1)$. To determine that now, we need to use the ratio test, which gives</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(n + 1)x^n}{nx^{n-1}} \right|\\&= |x|.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">Therefore, the series converges at least when $|x| < 1$, so the interval of convergence is $(-1, 1)$ at the smallest. Since the ratio test is inconclusive at the endpoints, we test those too, but both $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty n(1)^{n - 1}$ and $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty n(-1)^{n - 1}$ are divergent, so the interval of convergence is just $(-1, 1)$, as we expected.</p><br></div><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s look at one more nice property of power series: for the most part, they&#x2019;re all absolutely convergent, except possibly at the endpoints of the interval of convergence.</p><br><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: absolute convergence of power series</span></p><br><p class="body-text">Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n$ be a power series converging on $(a - R, a + R)$. Then the series converges absolutely on that interval.</p><br></div><p class="body-text">Again, this refers only to open intervals: if a series converges at the endpoint $a + R$, the convergence may be either conditional or absolute. In the case of the Alternating Harmonic series, it&#x2019;s right on the edge. We&#x2019;ve seen that it converges conditionally, but moving inward any amount causes the convergence to become absolute.</p><br><p class="body-text">One final result of this section is that we can confirm that power series representations of functions are unique: there can&#x2019;t be two different ways to represent one function as a power series if the interval of convergence matches. Suppose some function $f$ had two representations:</p><p class="body-text">$$f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty d_n (x - a)^n.$$</p><p class="body-text">By plugging in $x = a$ like in the last example (where $a$ was $0$), we have $f(a) = c_0 = d_0$, so the constant terms agree. Similarly, $f'(a) = c_1 = d_1$, since the constant terms vanish in the derivative. Now we know the first two terms match, and this process continues: $f''(a) = 2c_2 = 2d_2$, and so on. Any function expressible as a power series is differentiable and results in another power series which must itself be differentiable, and so <strong>every power series is infinitely differentiable!</strong> That means we can continue this process forever, and so the series must completely agree. We assumed that the two representations were centered at the same point $a$, and that&#x2019;s a necessary assumption: in the future, we&#x2019;ll see multiple different series representations of a function that differ by where they&#x2019;re centered. What we learned here is that for a given center, there&#x2019;s only one power series representation.</p><br><p class="body-text">So far, we&#x2019;ve got a good handle on how power series work and interact, and we even know representations of a few common functions. In the next section &mdash; the most important in the course &mdash; we&#x2019;ll extend the library of functions we can represent as power series to almost every function we&#x2019;ve ever seen, finally achieving the goal we layed out in the first section.</p><br><div class="notes-exercise notes-environment"><p class="body-text"><span class="notes-exercise-title">Exercise: expressing $e^x$ as a power series</span></p><br><p class="body-text">We know that $e^x$ has the special property of being the only function (other than constant multiples of $e^x$) which is its own derivative.
