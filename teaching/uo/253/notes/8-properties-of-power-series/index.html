!begin-text-block

	When series only contained numbers, we just had to understand them to the extent of determining whether they converged or not. Now that the terms have variables in them &mdash; in particular, different powers in each term, so that nothing can be combined &mdash; we need to be more comfortable dealing with series as objects in and of themselves, and not just unresolved sums that may or may not converge.

!text s Adding Power Series

<br>

	

!begin-text-block
	
	The first and simplest thing we can do to power series is to add two of them together. Thankfully, this works as well as we could hope.

!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	adding power series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$ be two power series that converge to the functions $f$ and $g$ on the intervals $I$ and $J$, respectively. Then the power series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (a_n + b_n) x^n
	$$
	
	converges to $f + g$ on the overlap of $I$ and $J$.

!end-prop



!begin-example

	adding power series
	
	Express the function
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)}
	$$
	
	as a power series and determine the interval of convergence.
	
	While we can express this as two series multiplied together, that&#x2019;s not ideal, and we don&#x2019;t know how to handle that sort of construction yet. Instead, let&#x2019;s turn to an old friend: partial fractions. That will let us write $f$ as the sum of two much simpler power series that we understand well, and then we can combine them using the previous proposition.
	
	Partial fractions tells us that for some numbers $A$ and $B$,
	
	$$
		\frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)} = \frac{A}{1 - 2x} + \frac{Bx + C}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	In other words,
	
	$$
		5 = A(1 + x^2) + (Bx + C)(1 - 2x) = (A + C) + (B - 2C)x + (A - 2B)x^2.
	$$
	
	We then separate this into three equations by equating the coefficients.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			5 &= A + C\\
			0 &= B - 2C\\
			0 &= A - 2B.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Working this out, we wind up with
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			A &= 4\\
			B &= 2\\
			C &= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, our expansion of the series $f$ becomes
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	Now all three of these terms have geometric series representations &mdash; we looked at many like them in the last section. First of all,
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 - 2x} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2x)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n),
	$$
	
	which converges when $|2x| < 1$, so $|x| < \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.
	
	For the other denominator, we have
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-x^2)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}).
	$$
	
	This series converges when $|-x^2| < 1$, so $|x| < 1$. The interval of convergence is therefore $(-1, 1)$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s put it all together. The sum of all three terms becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\\
			&= 4\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n) + 2x\sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}) + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n})\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (4 \cdot 2^n x^n + 2 \cdot (-1)^n x^{2n + 1} + (-1)^n x^{2n}).
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The two intervals of convergence are $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$ and $(-1, 1)$, and the overlap of those two is just the first one &mdash; therefore, the interval of convergence of our very complicated series is just $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.

!end-example



!begin-exercise

	adding power series
	
	Express the function
	
	$$
		g(x) = \frac{6}{(1 - x)(2 - x)(3 - x)}
	$$
	
	as a power series and determine the interval of convergence.

!end-exercise



!begin-text-block

	For many series, we now have the tools to go backward: determine the function it&#x2019;s converging to given just the series.

!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	finding a closed form of a series
	
	Define a function $f$ by
	
	$$
		f(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty 2^{-2n}x^n.
	$$
	
	Find a closed form for $f$ (i.e. a form without an infinite series).
	
	This looks a bit like a geometric series, but to apply the formula, we need every term to be raised to the power of $n$, not $-2n$. To that end, let&#x2019;s rewrite $2^{-2n}$ as $4^{-n} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n$, so that the series becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^n x^n\\
			&= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^n.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now this is very close to a geometric series, but it&#x2019;s starting at $n = 1$ instead of $n = 0$. To remedy that, we&#x2019;ll start it at $0$ and then remove the first term later.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= -\left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^0 + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \frac{x}{4} \right)^n\\
			&= -1 + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x}{4}}\\
			&= -1 + \frac{1}{\frac{4 - x}{4}}\\
			&= -1 + \frac{4}{4 - x}\\
			&= \frac{x}{4 - x}.
		\end{align*}
	$$

!text s Multiplying Power Series

<br>



!begin-text-block

	The process of adding power series closely mirrors adding polynomials: we just add the coefficients of like terms. Multiplying polynomials is a much more complicated process, though, and multiplying power series will take some extra work to pin down. Let&#x2019;s start with a motivating example and see what we can determine.
	
	Let $f(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2$ and $g(x) = 4 + 5x + 6x^2$. We normally write polynomials in descending order of their terms&#x2019; exponents, but this reverse order matches how power series are structured &mdash; low exponents come first.
	
	What is $f(x)g(x)$? We typically find this by foiling out the terms, but the end result is that every term of $f$ gets multiplied with every term of $g$, resulting in 9 terms total. Let&#x2019;s arrange that in a table.
	
	$$
		\begin{array}{r|ccc}
			& 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			\hline
			1 & 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			2x & 8x & 10x^2 & 12x^3\\
			3x^2 & 12x^2 & 15x^3 & 18x^4
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	Then the product $fg$ is just the sum of all nine entries in the table. There&#x2019;s a cleaner way to think of it, though: have a look at the diagonals running from the bottom-left to the top-right.
	
	$$
		\definecolor{textred}{rgb}{.85, 0, 0}
		\definecolor{textyellow}{rgb}{.85, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textgreen}{rgb}{0, .6, 0}
		\definecolor{textcyan}{rgb}{0, .6, 1}
		\definecolor{textblue}{rgb}{0, 0, 1}
		
		\begin{array}{r|ccc}
			& 4 & 5x & 6x^2\\
			\hline
			1 & {\color{textred} 4} & {\color{textyellow} 5x} & {\color{textgreen} 6x^2}\\
			2x & {\color{textyellow} 8x} & {\color{textgreen} 10x^2} & {\color{textcyan} 12x^3}\\
			3x^2 & {\color{textgreen} 12x^2} & {\color{textcyan} 15x^3} & {\color{textblue} 18x^4}
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	Here I&#x2019;ve color-coded the table by diagonals. The key observation is that those diagonals correspond to different exponents on $x$: for example, the green diagonal in the middle contains every $x^2$ term. Therefore, if we want to know the coefficient on $x^2$ in $f(x)g(x)$, we just need to add up those three.
	
	Let&#x2019;s make the jump to series. If $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $g(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$, then the product $f(x)g(x)$ will be the sum of an infinite table:
	
	$$
		\begin{array}{r|ccccc}
			& b_0 & b_1 x & b_2 x^2 & b_3 x^3 & \cdots\\
			\hline
			a_0 & a_0 b_0 & a_0 b_1 x & a_0 b_2 x^2 & a_0 b_3 x^3 & \cdots\\
			a_1 x & a_1 b_0 x & a_1 b_1 x^2 & a_1 b_2 x^3 & a_1 b_3 x^4 & \cdots\\
			a_2 x^2 & a_2 b_0 x^2 & a_2 b_1 x^3 & a_2 b_2 x^4 & a_2 b_3 x^5 & \cdots\\
			a_3 x^3 & a_3 b_0 x^3 & a_3 b_1 x^4 & a_3 b_2 x^5 & a_3 b_3 x^6 & \cdots\\
			\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
		\end{array}
	$$
	
	To extract the coefficient of $x^n$ in $fg$, we need to sum the $n$th diagonal. Now all of the terms $a_n x^n$ and $b_n x^n$ have the convenient property that their coefficients&#x2019; subscripts match the exponent on $x$, and multiplying two terms together makes the exponents add together. Therefore, the terms in the $n$th diagonal of our infinite table are the products of terms whose subscripts add to $n$. For instance, the sum of the $n = 3$ diagonal is
	
	$$
		(a_0 b_3 + a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 + a_3 b_0) x^3.
	$$
	
	To express this symbolically, the subscript on $a$ runs from $0$ to $3$ while the subscript on $b$ runs from $3$ down to $0$. In general, this looks like
	
	$$
		\left( \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k} \right) x^n.
	$$
	
	In total, the product of our two power series becomes
	
	$$
		f(x)g(x) = \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n \right) \left(\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n \right) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k} \right) x^n.
	$$

!begin-exercise

	multiplying power series
	
	earlier in the section, we expressed the function
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)}
	$$
	
	as a power series using partial fractions. Instead, express it as the product of two power series and verify that it matches the previous result through the first six terms.
