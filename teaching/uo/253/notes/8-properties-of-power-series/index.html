!header Section 8: Properties of Power Series

<br>



!begin-text-block

	When series only contained numbers, we only had to understand them to the extent of determining if they converged or not. Now that they contain variables &mdash; particularly different powers in each term, so that nothing can be combined &mdash; we need to be more comfortable with dealing with series as objects in and of themselves, and not just unresolved sums that may or may not converge.
	
	The first and simplest thing we can do to power series is to add two of them together. Thankfully, this works as well as we could hope.

!begin-prop
	
	adding power series
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n x^n$ and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n$ be two power series that converge to the functions $f$ and $g$ on the intervals $I$ and $J$, respectively. Then the power series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (a_n + b_n) x^n
	$$
	
	converges to $f + g$ on the overlap of $I$ and $J$.

!end-prop



!begin-example

	adding power series
	
	Express the function
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)}
	$$
	
	as a power series and determine the interval of convergence.
	
	While we can express this as two series multiplied together, that&#x2019;s not ideal, and we don&#x2019;t know how to handle that sort of construction yet. Instead, let&#x2019;s turn to an old friend: partial fractions. That will let us write $f$ as the sum of two much simpler power series that we understand well, and then we can combine them using the previous proposition.
	
	Partial fractions tells us that for some numbers $A$ and $B$,
	
	$$
		\frac{5}{(1 - 2x)(1 + x^2)} = \frac{A}{1 - 2x} + \frac{Bx + C}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	In other words,
	
	$$
		5 = A(1 + x^2) + (Bx + C)(1 - 2x) = (A + C) + (B - 2C)x + (A - 2B)x^2.
	$$
	
	We then separate this into three equations by equating the coefficients.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			5 &= A + C\\
			0 &= B - 2C\\
			0 &= A - 2B.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Working this out, we wind up with
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			A &= 4\\
			B &= 2\\
			C &= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, our expansion of the series $f$ becomes
	
	$$
		f(x) = \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}.
	$$
	
	Now all three of these terms have geometric series representations &mdash; we looked at many like them in the last section. First of all,
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 - 2x} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2x)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n),
	$$
	
	which converges when $|2x| < 1$, so $|x| < \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.
	
	For the other denominator, we have
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-x^2)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}).
	$$
	
	This series converges when $|-x^2| < 1$, so $|x| < 1$. The interval of convergence is therefore $(-1, 1)$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s put it all together. The sum of all three terms becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= \frac{4}{1 - 2x} + \frac{x}{1 + x^2} + \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\\
			&= 4\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (2^n x^n) + 2x\sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n}) + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty ((-1)^n x^{2n})\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (4 \cdot 2^n x^n + 2 \cdot (-1)^n x^{2n + 1} + (-1)^n x^{2n}).
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The two intervals of convergence are $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$ and $(-1, 1)$, and the overlap of those two is just the first one &mdash; therefore, the interval of convergence of our very complicated series is just $\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$.
