First, though, we&#x2019;re in desperate need of notation and terminology. At its worst, math can feel like pointless symbol-pushing, and so it&#x2019;s important to only add new notation when we truly need it to manage complexity. The best notation bottles up a moderately tricky idea and makes it usable without having to interface with it all the time.</p><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s begin with something we see everywhere: the set of all real numbers. A <strong>real</strong> number is any one on the number line, whether rational or irrational &mdash; for example, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="0">$0$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\pi">$\pi$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="e">$e$</span>, and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\sqrt{2}">$\sqrt{2}$</span> are all real. We write the whole set of them as <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}">$\mathbb{R}$</span>, a rather fancy-looking R, and to actually use that symbol most of the time, we need one more: <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\in">$\in$</span>. This one means &#x201C;element of&#x201D;, and it lets us write the rather verbose &#x201C;let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> be a real number&#x201D; as simply &#x201C;let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x \in \mathbb{R}">$x \in \mathbb{R}$</span>&#x201D;, read &#x201C;let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> be in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}">$\mathbb{R}$</span>&#x201D;.</p><p class="body-text">A length-<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span> vector just consists of two independent real numbers &mdash; it&#x2019;s effectively an ordered pair. If each element of an ordered pair has three possibilities (say <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$</span> can each independently be <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span>, or <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="3">$3$</span> in the pair <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$</span>), then there are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="3^2 = 9">$3^2 = 9$</span> possibilities for the whole pair. Inspired by the power of two, we write <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^2">$\mathbb{R}^2$</span> (read &#x201C;R two&#x201D;) for the set of all ordered pairs &mdash; or equivalently, the set of all length-2 vectors. Similarly, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^n">$\mathbb{R}^n$</span> is the set of all length-<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="n">$n$</span> vectors.</p><p class="body-text">That&#x2019;s a fair amount of symbols, but it&#x2019;s thankfully all we&#x2019;ll have for a while. With the notation in place, we can start talking about the math.</p><p class="body-text">First of all, vectors are just matrices with a single column, so all of the nice properties of matrix arithmetic carry over to them. Two vectors of the same length add together by just adding each corresponding entry, and two vectors of different lengths cannot be added together at all. We can multiply a vector by a scalar <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$</span> (i.e. just a number) by multiplying each entry by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$</span>. None of this is different from matrices, but what&#x2019;s new to vectors is the ability to visualize them in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^n">$\mathbb{R}^n$</span>. When <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="n = 2">$n = 2$</span>, we have <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^2">$\mathbb{R}^2$</span>, which is just the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="xy">$xy$</span>-plane &mdash; every length-<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span> vector corresponds to a point in the plane. We typically think of these as <em>directions</em> rather than locations, and we draw them as arrows from the origin.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="plane-vectors" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">When we add vectors, we add corresponding components together, so the result is a vector from the origin with the total amount of movement of both vectors in both the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$</span> directions. Geometrically, we can place the vectors one after the other so that the second begins where the first ends &mdash; then the sum is the vector that travels from the beginning of the first to the end of the second, since it has the total <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$</span> movement of both vectors.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="vector-addition" class="desmos-container"></div></div><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main>
