You&#x2019;re viewing the interactive lecture notes &mdash; reading these is required for the class, since we&#x2019;ll have a short reading quiz on Canvas due before most lectures.

It underpins nearly every math course that comes after it in one way or another, and it&#x2019;s so important in other STEM fields that when they talk about math, they often just mean linear algebra. With such an impressive resume, it might be surprising to hear that linear algebra is no more than a formalized, organized way to solve systems of linear equations &mdash; at least, that&#x2019;s how it gets started. As we&#x2019;ll quickly see, formalizing that process will result in an unreasonably useful set of tools and definitions with applications far beyond what it was designed for.</p><p class="body-text">Unlike most math classes that have come before, this one is a clean break from its prerequisites: there isn&#x2019;t much to review that will be useful. Instead, we&#x2019;ll be building our theory of linear algebra more or less from scratch &mdash; to that end, let&#x2019;s take a look at our central object of study: systems of linear equations. <em>Linear</em> means that variables aren&#x2019;t multiplied or raised to powers, just added together, so when there are only two variables, the graph is a line.</p><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: a system of linear equations</span></p><p class="body-text">Solve the system</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[NEWLINE][TAB]2x_1 - 3x_2 &= 8.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[4px]2x_1 - 3x_2 &= 8.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">We could use substitution by solving the first equation for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_1">$x_1$</span> and substituting it into the second, but let&#x2019;s think critically about that. Substitution doesn&#x2019;t scale well &mdash; if we had <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="n">$n$</span> equations and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="n">$n$</span> unknowns, solving by substitution means isolating and plugging in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="n - 1">$n - 1$</span> equations until we finally reach the end, and then we have to do a large amount of back-substitution. That&#x2019;s not to mention the complexity that arises when not every equation contains every variable, and we have to carefully pick and choose our order. We&#x2019;re trying to build a general solving method here, and so we owe it to ourselves to make a better foundation.</p><p class="body-text">It may have been a while since you learned about solving systems of linear equations, but you probably learned another solving method, different from substitution. It&#x2019;s usually called the method of <strong>addition</strong>, and critically for us, it&#x2019;s much more scalable. We begin by looking at the top-left term in the system (i.e. <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_1">$x_1$</span>) and adding copies of the entire first equation down to the others to clear their <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_1">$x_1$</span> terms. Here, that means adding <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="-2">$-2$</span> times the first equation down to the second, resulting in</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[NEWLINE][TAB]- 7x_2 &= 14.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[4px]- 7x_2 &= 14.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">At this point, we can divide the second equation through by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="-7">$-7$</span> to find that <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_2 = -2">$x_2 = -2$</span>:</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[NEWLINE][TAB]x_2 &= -2.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}x_1 + 3x_2 &= -5\\[4px]x_2 &= -2.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">Instead of substituting that into the first equation, we&#x2019;ll add <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="-3">$-3$</span> times the entire second equation up to the first.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]x_1 &= 1\\[NEWLINE][TAB]x_2 &= -2.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}x_1 &= 1\\[4px]x_2 &= -2.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">So &mdash; why does this supposedly scale better? The key is in the organization. The variables stayed on the left and the constants on the right, and we only had to look at two coefficients at a time to figure out how many of one equation to add to another. As the number of variables and equations increases, the number of operations required to do both substitution and addition increases, but the <em>complexity</em> of those operations doesn&#x2019;t increase with addition.</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: a system of linear equations</span></p><p class="body-text">Solve the system</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]2x_1 - x_2 &= -6\\[NEWLINE][TAB]-4x_1 - 3x_2 &= 12.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}2x_1 - x_2 &= -6\\[4px]-4x_1 - 3x_2 &= 12.\end{align*}$$</span></p></div><p class="body-text">Now that we&#x2019;ve worked through an example, we&#x2019;re prepared to define linear systems in general.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: linear system</span></p><p class="body-text">A general linear equation in the variables <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_1, x_2, ..., x_n">$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$</span> has the form</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">for some constants <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="a_i">$a_i$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="b">$b$</span>.

Depending on the particular equations, a system can have a single solution, no solutions, or infinitely many. Geometrically, linear equations form straight lines (or planes in higher dimensions), and the points where they all intersect are the solutions. In the example below, setting <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="a = 1">$a = 1$</span> results in the two lines being parallel, so there are no intersection points and therefore no solutions. When <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="a = 0">$a = 0$</span>, the lines are the same (we sometimes say they <strong>coincide</strong>), and so there are infinitely many solutions. For all other values of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="a">$a$</span>, the lines intersect at exactly one point, meaning there is a unique solution.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="linear-system" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">We&#x2019;ll develop vocabulary to describe all of these situations shortly, but the most pressing issue is that it&#x2019;s unwieldy to deal with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="m">$m$</span> different equations at once. If we could consolidate all <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="m">$m$</span> of them into a single equation that still contained all the data, it would make the discussion of linear systems quite a bit simpler.</p><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s start with the right sides &mdash; the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="b_i">$b_i$</span>. There are quite a few ways we could try to combine them all into one single object, but let&#x2019;s just follow our nose and try the simplest thing we can. When we write the equations in a row like we did above, the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="b_i">$b_i$</span> form a column. To that end, let&#x2019;s create an object that contains all of the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="b_i">$b_i$</span> at once.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: column vector</span></p><p class="body-text">A <strong>column vector</strong> is a vertical rectangle of numbers of the form</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]\left[ \begin{array}{c} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \cdots \\ b_m \end{array} \right].[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}\left[ \begin{array}{c} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \cdots \\ b_m \end{array} \right].\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">We say that a column vector has length <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="m">$m$</span>, or that its dimensions are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="m \times 1">$m \times 1$</span> (since there&#x2019;s only one column).</p></div><p class="body-text">Just like ordered pairs, two column vectors are equal only if they&#x2019;re the same length and all of their entries are equal.

To really cut through the noise and get to a good generalization, we need to go one step further. In a linear system with two unknowns, there will always be a single copy of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_1">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x_2">$x_2$</span> in each equation. What changes is the coefficients &mdash; the only part of the left side that matters are the four numbers <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="3">$3$</span>, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="-3">$-3$</span>. As before, let&#x2019;s try the simplest possible organization. When we write out the equations, they form a square, so let&#x2019;s use vector notation and put them into a <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2 \times 2">$2 \times 2$</span> rectangle:</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & -3 \end{array} \right].[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & -3 \end{array} \right].\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">We call this a <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2 \times 2">$2 \times 2$</span> <strong>matrix</strong>.

Second, it&#x2019;s almost always worth trying the simplest idea first in math &mdash; quite often, everything will fall in place as if it was meant to be, and it will feel as though you&#x2019;re discovering the theory instead of inventing it.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main>
