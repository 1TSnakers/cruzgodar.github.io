We often talk about points in the plane as being locations, but we often find ourselves wanting for a quantity to represent <em>changes</em> in location too. Those are more versatile, in substantive ways: we can add them together, for example, while adding locations isn&#x2019;t something that&#x2019;s well-defined. Without further ado, let&#x2019;s define vectors and see how to represent them</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><div class="notes-def-title notes-title">Definition: vectors</div><p class="body-text">A <strong>vector</strong> is a 2-dimensional quantity with magnitude and direction. Visually, we represent vectors as arrows in the plane, representing moving from the tail of the vector to the tip. The <strong>magnitude</strong> of a vector is the length from the tail to the tip, and the <strong>angle</strong> of a vector is the angle as measured counterclockwise from the positive <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$-direction.</span></p></div><div class="desmos-border"><div id="vectors" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Here, dragging the red point <strong>doesn&#x2019;t change the vector</strong>. Since vectors are determined by their direction and length, moving one around doesn&#x2019;t change it. Standard notation for vectors is to use letters with arrows above them, as in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$</span> or <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{w}">$\vec{w}$.</span> We also denote the <strong>zero vector</strong> as <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{0}">$\vec{0}$,</span> which is the unique vector with length zero.</p></section><h2 class="section-text">Vector Arithmetic</h2><section><p class="body-text">Suppose the displacement from Eugene to Portland is given by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$,</span> and the displacement from Portland to Bend is given by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{w}">$\vec{w}$.</span> The total displacement from Eugene to Bend should then be some combination of the two vectors &mdash; specifically the sum of the two, since that should give us the <em>total</em> displacement from Eugene to Bend. The takeaway is that to add two vectors, we place the tail of one at the tip of the other, and draw the vector connecting the tail of the first to the tip of the second.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="vectorAddition" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Here, the blue and red vectors are added together to give the purple one. The dashed vectors are the same, but added in a different order, giving the exact same result. With our previous example, if we first traveled from Eugene along the vector from Portland to Bend, we&#x2019;d end up somewhere around Crater lake; if we then traveled from there along the vector from Eugene to Portland, we&#x2019;d arrive exactly in Bend.</p><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><div class="notes-exc-title notes-title">Exercise: vector addition</div><p class="body-text">Let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{w}">$\vec{w}$</span> be the vectors that both start at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(0, 0)">$(0, 0)$</span> and end at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\left( 2, 2\sqrt{3} \right)">$\left( 2, 2\sqrt{3} \right)$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\left( -3, 0 \right)">$\left( -3, 0 \right)$,</span> respectively. What is the length of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v} + \vec{w}">$\vec{v} + \vec{w}$?</span></p></div><p class="body-text">Adding a vector <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$</span> to itself should result in a vector <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v} + \vec{v} = 2\vec{v}">$\vec{v} + \vec{v} = 2\vec{v}$,</span> and since we can find <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v} + \vec{v}">$\vec{v} + \vec{v}$</span> by placing two copies of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$,</span> one after another, the result is just a vector in the same direction as <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$,</span> but twice as long. Similarly, if vector addition exists, then vector subtraction should too, and we really ought to have <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v} - \vec{v} = \vec{0}">$\vec{v} - \vec{v} = \vec{0}$.</span> That means <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v} = (-1)\vec{v}">$\vec{v} = (-1)\vec{v}$</span> should be a vector with the same length as <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$,</span> but in the opposite direction. These two examples give us a hint as to how we ought to define <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c\vec{v}">$c\vec{v}$</span> for any number <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$.</span></p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><div class="notes-def-title notes-title">Definition: vector scaling</div><p class="body-text">Let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{v}">$\vec{v}$</span> be a vector and let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$</span> be a number.
