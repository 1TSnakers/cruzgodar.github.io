Times are TBD!</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What materials will I need?</h2><p class="body-text">Not many! While we have a textbook for this class, it is completely optional. Between the notes and homework on the website, we have everything the textbook would provide, but with the benefit of staying much more in sync with the course. If you&#x2019;d like the book regardless, either for extra practice problems beyond the homework or just a different perspective on the course material, it&#x2019;s <em>Elementary Differential Equations, 11th edition</em>, by William Boyce.</p><p class="body-text">A scientific calculator can save you time with simple calculations, but it&#x2019;s not required. You can always leave your final answers unsimplified, and the quizzes and exams are written so that necessary computations are doable by hand.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What will I be graded on?</h2><p class="body-text">Your grade is determined by your class participation and scores on a number of different assignments, weighted as follows:</p><p class="body-text">In-class participation: 5%</p><p class="body-text">Reading quizzes: 5%</p><p class="body-text">In-class quizzes: 10%</p><p class="body-text">Homework: 15%</p><p class="body-text">Midterms: 20% each (40% total)</p><p class="body-text">Final: 25%</p><p class="body-text">More on all of these in the coming sections! Your final class grade will be rounded up to the next integer &mdash; for example, a final grade of 88.2% will be rounded to 89% and awarded a B+.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What will the homework be like?</h2><p class="body-text">The homework is available on this site, and there will be roughly 30 problems due each week. Your grade is out of 12 points &mdash; 4 are for thoroughly attempting every problem regardless of whether your answers are correct, and I&#x2019;ll select two problems per homework to grade on correctness for 4 points each. On longer problems, I&#x2019;ll provide answers when possible so you can see if you&#x2019;re on the right track before the homework is submitted.</p><p class="body-text">All of our homework is submitted through Canvas. One option is to handwrite your work and then scan it with a scanning app that produces PDFs (e.g. the scanner in the Files app on iOS or Adobe Scan on Android). Another option that I highly recommend is to try typing your homework with Latex. This is how scientific papers and books (and our notes and homework) are written, and it has the benefit of being easily editable if you make a mistake part of the way through a problem. The simplest way to get started is to make an account at <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>, and to make things as easy as possible, <strong>every bit of math in the homework can be clicked or tapped to show the Latex source</strong>. Try it on the equation below!</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE]\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = 1[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = 1\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">Typing your homework is completely optional, but I encourage you to give it a shot! If you plan to go into any STEM field, this is something you&#x2019;ll have to learn eventually.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What should I expect from the quizzes and exams?</h2><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What are the best things I can do to succeed?</h2><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What is the policy regarding late work, make-ups, and dropped assignments?</h2><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What if I&#x2019;m registered with the AEC or think I should be?</h2><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> What are the skills I can expect to learn from this course?</h2><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 32px"> Is there anything else I should know?</h2></div></section></main><script src="/scripts/init.min.js"></script></body></html>
