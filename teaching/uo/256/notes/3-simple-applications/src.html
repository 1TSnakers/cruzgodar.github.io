# Section 3: Simple Applications

With a few solving techniques in the toolbelt, we're ready to look at a handful of applications of first-order DEs. There are dozens upon hundreds of these --- any situation where it's easier to find a formula for the rate of change of a quantity than a formula for the quantity itself is one --- but we'll stick to a few classics for now.



## Tanks

Unlike the tank problems from calculus II that involve finding the work done by pumping all of the liquid out of a tank, here the volume will remain constant. What we're concerned with is the mixing of two substances and determining the concentration over time. Let's get straight into an example.



### ex a mixing problem
	
	A $1000$ liter tank of water contains $20\,\text{kg}$ of salt dissolved in it. We begin pouring in a brine solution with a salt concentration of $0.1\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}$ at a rate of $2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. At the same time, we begin draining well-mixed solution from the bottom of the tank at the same rate of $2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. After $30$ minutes, what will the mass of salt in the tank be? What will the long-term mass approach?
	
	There's a lot to digest here! It's always a good idea to name some variables so we can start building equations --- to that end, let's let $Q(t)$ be the mass of salt in the tank after $t$ minutes. Since the only information we're given refers to the way in which $Q$ changes, we'll want to find $Q$ in a DE first, then solve that to get an explicit formula.
	
	So --- what's the rate of change of the mass of salt in the tank? It's just the amount coming in minus the amount going out, and neither is terribly hard to find. Since mass is equal to density times volume, the mass per minute entering the tank is
	
	$$
		\left( 0.1\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}} \right) \left( 2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \right) = 0.2\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}.
	$$
	
	The mass of salt leaving the tank per minute at time $t$ is a little more complicated. The formula looks similar to the previous one, but since the tank is well-mixed, the density involves $Q$ itself:
	
	$$
		\left( \frac{Q}{1000}\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}} \right) \left( 2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \right) = \frac{Q}{500}\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}.
	$$
	
	Now we're ready to write down an expression for $Q'$, which has become a first-order DE.
	
	$$
		Q' = 0.2 - \frac{Q}{500}.
	$$
	
	In order to pin down a particular solution, we're going to need to know at least one value of $Q(t)$. That's where the $20\,\text{kg}$ comes in: $Q(0) = 20$. Now we can get to solving --- this DE is linear, so we can solve it with an integrating factor.
	
	$$
		Q' + \frac{Q}{500} &= 0.2
		
		\mu(t) &= \exp \left( \int \frac{1}{500}\,dt \right)
		
		\mu(t) &= \exp\left( \frac{t}{500} \right)
		
		\mu(t) &= e^{t / 500}
		
		e^{t / 500}Q' + \frac{1}{500} e^{t / 500} Q &= 0.2 e^{t / 500}
		
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ e^{t / 500} Q \right] &= 0.2 e^{t / 500}
		
		e^{t / 500} Q &= \int 0.2 e^{t / 500}\,dt
		
		Q &= e^{-t / 500} \left( 0.2 \cdot 500 e^{t / 500} + c \right)
		
		Q &= 100 + c e^{-t / 500}.
	$$
	
	Now we can use the initial condition to solve for $c$ as usual:
	
	$$
		20 &= 100 + ce^{-0 / 500}
		
		c &= -80
		
		Q &= 100 - 80 e^{-t / 500}.
	$$
	
	The first value we're trying to find is $Q(30) \approx 24.66\,\text{kg}$, and the second is
	
	$$
		\lim_{t \to \infty} Q(t) = 100.
	$$
	
	Thankfully, that checks out with the problem! After a long enough time, the concentration in the tank will approach the concentration we're pouring in, which is $0.1,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}$, so we'd expect the mass to approach $0.1 \cdot 1000 = 100$.

### exc a mixing problem
	
	A $10$ liter tank of water contains $2\,\text{g}$ of sugar dissolved in it. We begin pouring in a sugar solution with a salt concentration of $1\,\frac{\text{g}}{\text{L}}$ at a rate of $10\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$ and draining the well-mixed solution at the same rate of $10\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. After $20$ minutes, what will the mass of sugar in the tank be, and what will the mass approach in the long term?
