The type of DE we've been studying for the past two sections has the extremely particular description of second-order, linear, constant-coefficient, and homogeneous --- put simply, they're DEs of the form $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$. Now that we completely understand how to solve them, we'd like to move on to slightly more general DEs by dropping one of the four adjectives. We'll get to higher-order DEs in the next section, but there's still plenty to say about second-order ones, so we'll keep that here for now. Nonlinear second-order equations are substantially more difficult to solve and are well outside the scope of the class, so we'll be sticking with linear ones. Unfortunately, DEs with non-constant coefficients are also quite difficult to solve, and while we'll have a small amount to say about them later this section, we won't be discussing them in general. The only part we can generalize is homogeneity --- in other words, we'll be looking at DEs of the form

$$
	ay'' + by' + cy = g(t)
$$

for some function $g(t)$. We'd like to reuse as much as possible from the previous sections to avoid having to rework lots of new theory from scratch, and our first result will let us do just that.



### thm general solutions to nonhomogeneous DEs
	
	Let
	
	$$
		y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t)
	$$
	
	be a nonhomogeneous second-order linear DE and let $y_c(t) = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ be the general solution to the homogeneous DE

	$$
		y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0.
	$$
	
	If $Y(t)$ is any particular solution to the nonhomogeneous DE, then the general solution is
	
	$$
		y = y_c + Y.
	$$
	
###



So to find the general solution to a nonhomogeneous DE, we just need to find a single solution and add it to the general solution of the homogeneous version. This isn't incredibly surprising: plugging $y = y_c + Y$ into the DE results in the $y_c$ terms combining to zero and the $Y$ terms combining to $g(t)$.
