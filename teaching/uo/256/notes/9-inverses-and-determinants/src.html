Part of the confusion surrounding matrices comes from the heavily-blurred line between matrix multiplication and function composition --- but at the same time, many of the most powerful uses of matrices come from playing those two perspectives off of one another. One of the goals of this section will be to take a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and produce an **inverse matrix** $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ that undoes $\mathbf{A}$. By multiplying both sides of an equation $\mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{b}$ by $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$, we'll be able to solve for $\mathbf{x}$ all at once.

First of all, let's talk about the identity matrix. We mentioned it briefly in the last section, but it's worth revisting now that we understand more about matrix multiplication. The $n \times n$ identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ is given by

$$
	\mathbf{I} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right],
$$

and its purpose is to serve as the identity function, meaning it leaves things unchanged when multiplied by them. (You'll verify in a homework problem that $\mathbf{AI} = \mathbf{IA} = \mathbf{A}$ for any matrix $\mathbf{A}$). In the language of multiplication, $\mathbf{I}$ is the equivalent of the number $1$, and in the language of functions, it is the equivalent of the identity function $f(x) = x$.
