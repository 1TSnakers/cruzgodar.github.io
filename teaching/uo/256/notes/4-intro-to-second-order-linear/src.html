# Section 4: Intro to Second-Order Linear DEs

### nav-buttons

Let's take a moment to summarize where we are in the course so far. First-order DEs are complicated, but we have a handful of results about them. We can solve any first-order linear DE with integrating factors, and there are two special types of first-order nonlinear DEs --- separable and exact --- that we can also solve with other methods. As a stark example of the general difficulty of the subject of differential equations, moving just one order higher will force us to narrow our scope drastically. We'll only be considering second-order linear DEs, and even then, it will take us a handful of sections to develop partial solving methods. It may come as little surprise that we will have a relatively small amount to say about third-order and higher DEs --- the difficulty curve is drastic.
