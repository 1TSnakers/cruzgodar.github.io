Our final topic will be **nonlinear systems**, like the Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey relationships. Some of the methods we'll use to understand and classify them apply to linear systems too, and so we'll start there.

Let's let $\mathbf{A}$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix and look at the system $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{Ax}$. As we touched on in homework 8, the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ determine the general behavior of the system --- let's summarize the possibilities here. First of all, we'll need a few definitions of vector field concepts 



### def sources, sinks, and saddles
	
	In a vector field, a **critical point** is a point $(x, y)$ for which there is no motion. If the field around a critical point exclusively flows away from it, the point is called a **source**. If the surrounding field exclusively flows toward the point, it's called a **sink**. Otherwise, the point is called a **saddle point**.

In the field below, the top-right critical point is a source, the bottom-left is a sink, and the other two are saddle points.
