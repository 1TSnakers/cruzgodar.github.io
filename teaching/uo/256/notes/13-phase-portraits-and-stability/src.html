Our final topic will be **nonlinear systems**, like the Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey relationships. Some of the methods we'll use to understand and classify them apply to linear systems too, and so we'll start there. First of all, we'll need a few definitions of vector field objects.



### def sources, sinks, and saddles
	
	In a vector field, a **critical point** is a point $(x, y)$ for which there is no motion. If the field around a critical point exclusively flows away from it, the point is called a **source**. If the surrounding field exclusively flows toward the point, it's called a **sink**. If some flows toward the point and some flows away, it's called a **saddle point**. Finally, if the field simply spirals around the point and none flows toward or away, it's called a **center**.

In the field below, the top-right critical point is a source, the bottom-left is a sink, and the other two are saddle points.

Let's look at the system $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{Ax}$. As we touched on in homework 8, the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ determine the general behavior of the system --- let's summarize the possibilities here.

If $\mathbf{A}$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with real entries and nonzero eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, then there is a single critical point at the origin, and the system has the following characteristics:

	> 1. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are real and positive, then the critical point is a source.

	> 2. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are real and negative, then the critical point is a sink.

	> 3. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are real and have opposite signs, then the critical point is a saddle point.

	> 4. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are complex conjugates and the real part is positive, then the critical point is a center.

	> 5. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are complex conjugates and the real part is negative, then the critical point is a sink about which the field spirals.

	> 6. If $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are complex conjugates and the real part is zero, then the field simply spirals about the critical point.



These six possibilities are explored thoroughly in homework 8, but it'd be nice to avoid memorizing all of this, and hopefully to understand the meaning behind it all a bit more. The eigenvectors of the matrix determine the lines along which the field flows to or from the source, and the sign of the real part of the corresponding eigenvalues determine whether that flow is toward the source (negative) or away (positive). Imaginary parts of eigenvalues introduce curl into the system, turning the field into a spiral.

Drag the red point to change the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The blue curves are sample solutions, and the ones marked in black are the two fundamental solutions --- all together, we call this a **phase portrait** of the system.



### ex phase portraits
	
	Given the following phase portrait for $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{Ax}$, what can we determine about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}$?
	
	### desmos vector-field-2
	
	Since all of the solutions approach straight lines as $t \to \infty$ or $t \to -\infty$, there is no curl in this system --- the eigenvalues and eigenvectors must be real. The eigenvectors are parallel to the straight line solutions (being on a straight-line solution is what it means to be an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$), so the eigenvectors appear to be
	
	$$
		\mathbf{v_1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right], \quad \mathbf{v_2} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} -3 \\ 1 \end{array} \right].
	$$
	
	What about the eigenvalues? The fundamental solution corresponding to $\mathbf{v_1}$ flows toward the origin, so its eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ must be negative. On the other hand, the fundamental solution corresponding to $\mathbf{v_2}$ flows away from the origin, so its eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ must be positive.

## Autonomous Systems

Let's take our first step into nonlinear systems. Since we were barely able to solve any nonlinear individual first-order DEs, we shouldn't expect to be able to solve any nonlinear system. Instead, we'll work with a particular kind of nonlinear system: one that doesn't involve $t$ at all.



### def autonomous system
	
	A system of two DEs is **autonomous** if it is of the form
	
	$$
		x' &= f(x, y)
		
		y' &= g(x, y)
	$$
	
	for continuous functions $f$ and $g$.

For a nonlinear system, we don't have nearly as nice of a classification of critical points. Instead, we'll just classify them as **stable** or **unstable**, depending on whether trajectories stay near the point or don't. Stable solutions are effectively sinks and centers, and unstable ones are all the rest. Analyzing autonomous systems can be quite hard in general, but for particularly nice functions $f$ and $g$, it's possible to solve explicitly --- typically, we'll hope to use a modified form of separation of variables.



### ex an autonomous system
	
	Solve the system
	
	$$
		x' &= y^2
		
		y' &= 1 - x^2.
	$$
	
	Find and classify the critical points.
	
	Since neither $x'$ or $y'$ depends on $t$, this system is autonomous. The chain rule says that $\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}$, so solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ gives us
	
	$$
		\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}
		
		&= \frac{y'}{x'}
		
		&= \frac{1 - x^2}{y^2}.
	$$
	
	To solve for $y$, we can separate and integrate.
	
	$$
		y^2\,dy &= (1-x^2)\,dx
		
		\int y^2\,dy &= \int (1-x^2)\,dx
		
		\frac{y^3}{3} &= x - \frac{x^3}{3} + c
		
		x^3 + y^3 - 3x = c.
	$$
	
	Varying $c$, we can see all of the different trajectories a point can follow in the field.
	
	### desmos autonomous-system
	
	To find the critical points, we just solve $x' = y' = 0$. That means $y^2 = 0$ and $1 - x^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$ and $x = \pm 1$. Classifying them is more complex, and for us, it frequently requires inspecting the vector field. Here, we see that both critical points are unstable, since trajectories near the points don't fall into them.
