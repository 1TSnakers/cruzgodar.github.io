# Section 9: The Inverse Function Theorem

### nav-buttons

With the chain rule under our belt, we can differentiate any combination of two differentiable functions. There is one more way we can construct new functions &mdash; rather than putting two functions together, it starts from a single function. What we&#x2019;re talking about here is function inversion, and it&#x2019;s often a point of confusion in algebra, just like composition. So, just like composition, let&#x2019;s review.



### def one-to-one
	
	A function $y = f(x)$ is **one-to-one** if it passes the horizontal line test &mdash; that is, every $y$-value comes from only one $x$-value.
	
###



### ex one-to-one
	
	The function $f(x) = x^2$ is not one-to-one, since $4 = f(-2) = f(2)$. On the other hand, $g(x) = x^5$ is one-to-one, since it passes the horizontal line test: every horizontal line intersects the graph at one point at most.
	
###



### def inverse function
	
	Let $y = f(x)$ be a one-to-one function. The **inverse** to $f$ is the function $x = f^{-1}(y)$, defined so that if $(x, y)$ is a point on the graph of $f$, then $(y, x)$ is a point on the graph of $f^{-1}$.
	
###



So $f^{-1}$ undoes $f$: it takes outputs of $f$ back to their corresponding inputs. In other words, $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and $f(f^{-1}(x))$. This is why we need $f$ to be one-to-one: if two different $x$-values get sent to the same $y$-value, then the inverse function won&#x2019;t know which one to send that $y$-value back to.



### ex inverse functions
	
	The inverse to $f(x) = x^5$ is $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt[5]{y}$, and the inverse to $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{y}$.
	
###

### exc inverse functions
	
	Find the inverse functions to $f(x) = e^x$ and $f(x) = \displaystyle \frac{x - 1}{x + 1}$. Hint: let $y = f(x)$ and solve for $x$.
	
###



While none of the six trig functions is one-to-one, we still really want to talk about their inverses. To help do that, we restrict their domain until they become one-to-one. This is a somewhat complicated subject that&#x2019;s not all that important for our purposes, so we&#x2019;ll gloss over it. All we need to know is that there are functions $\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\cos^{-1}(x)$, and so on, that undo the corresponding trig functions. For example, since $\sin(\theta)$ gives the $y$-coordinate of a point on the unit circle with angle $\theta$, $\sin^{-1}(y)$ gives the angle $\theta$ with that $y$-coordinate.

Now that we&#x2019;ve reviewed inverse functions, let&#x2019;s talk about their derivatives.



### thm the Inverse Function Theorem
	
	Let $f$ be a differentiable function. Then
	
	$$
		(f^{-1})'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}.
	$$
	
###



So in order to use the IFT, we need to know $f'$ and $f^{-1}$, and then we compose the two.



### ex the Inverse Function Theorem
	
	Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} [\sqrt{x}]$.
	
	To apply the IFT, the left side needs to be the inverse function, which means we need to find a function $f(x)$ so that $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}$. But since inverting a function twice gives back the original function, we can do this by just inverting $y = \sqrt{x}$, which just means solving for $x$. That gives us $x = y^2$, so we want to define $f(x) = x^2$. Then $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}$. (There is a minor problem with being one-to-one &mdash; everything is fine, but it can be a little tricky to parse out why. Feel free to ignore it.)
	
	Now $f'(x) = 2x$, so $f'(f^{-1}(x)) = 2\sqrt{x}$. Then we have
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dx} [\sqrt{x}] = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}.
	$$
	
	Hey, that&#x2019;s what we would have expected to get! It seems like the pattern of $\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$ might work for more than if $n$ is just an integer.
	
###

### exc the Inverse Function Theorem
	
	Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx} \left[\sqrt[3]{x}\right]$ using the Inverse Function Theorem.
	
###



### thm the derivative of $x^n$ for rational $n$
	
	Let $n$ be a rational number. Then $\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$.
	
###

### pf
	
	We can actually do the proof of this one! We don&#x2019;t get too many chances to present them, so let&#x2019;s take this one. Since $n$ is rational, we can write it as $n = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Then
	
	$$
		x^n = x^{a/b} = (x^{1/b})^a.
	$$
	
	Let $f(x) = x^b$, so that $f^{-1}(x) = x^{1/b}$. Then $f'(x) = bx^{b - 1}$, which we know because $b$ is an integer, and so
	
	$$
		f'(f^{-1}(x)) = bx^{(b-1)/b}
	$$
	
	By the IFT,
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^{1/b}\right] &= \frac{1}{bx^{(b-1)/b}}\\
			&= \frac{1}{b} x^{-(b-1)/b}\\
			&= \frac{1}{b} x^{\frac{1}{b} - 1}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now we can use the chain rule to find the derivative of $x^{a/b}$.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx}\left[(x^{1/b})^a\right] &= a(x^{1/b})^{a-1} \cdot \frac{1}{b} x^{\frac{1}{b} - 1}\\
			&= \frac{a}{b} x^{\frac{a-1}{b} + \frac{1}{b} - 1}\\
			&= \frac{a}{b} x^{\frac{a}{b} - 1}\\
			&= nx^{n - 1}.\\
		\end{align*}
	$$

## The Derivatives of the Inverse Trig Functions
	
Somewhat strangely, the derivatives of the inverse trig functions are not other inverse trig functions &mdash; they&#x2019;re rational functions. We can find these with the IFT, but the process requires drawing right triangles. If you take Calculus II, you&#x2019;ll need to thoroughly learn this technique, and since it&#x2019;s not all that important to us right now, we&#x2019;re not going to cover it in this class. Instead, let&#x2019;s skip straight to the result.



### thm the derivatives of the inverse trig functions
	
	1. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\sin^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$.
	
	2. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\cos^{-1}(x)] = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$.
	
	3. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\tan^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.
	
	4. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\sec^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}$.
	
	5. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\csc^{-1}(x)] = -\frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}$.
	
	6. $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\cot^{-1}(x)] = -\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.

### ex an inverse trig derivative
	
	Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\left[\tan^{-1}(x^3)\right]$.
	
	By the Chain Rule, we have
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dx}[\tan^{-1}(x^3)] = \frac{1}{1 + (x^3)^2} \cdot 3x^2 = \frac{3x^2}{1 + x^6}.
	$$
