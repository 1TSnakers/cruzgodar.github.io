!begin-text-block
	
	With the Chain Rule under our belt, we can differentiate any combination of two differentiable functions. There is one more way we can construct new functions &mdash; rather than putting two functions together, it starts from a single function. What we&#x2019;re talking about here is function inversion, and it&#x2019;s often a point of confusion in algebra, just like composition. So, just like composition, let&#x2019;s review.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	one-to-one
	
	A function $y = f(x)$ is <dfn>one-to-one</dfn> if it passes the horizontal line test &mdash; that is, every $y$-value comes from only one $x$-value.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	one-to-one
	
	The function $f(x) = x^2$ is not one-to-one, since $4 = f(-2) = f(2)$. On the other hand, $g(x) = x^5$ is one-to-one, since it passes the horizontal line test: every horizontal line intersects the graph at one point at most.
	
!end-example



!begin-def
	
	inverse function
	
	Let $y = f(x)$ be a one-to-one function. The <dfn>inverse</dfn> to $f$ is the function $x = f^{-1}(y)$, defined so that if $(x, y)$ is a point on the graph of $f$, then $(y, x)$ is a point on the graph of $f^{-1}$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	So $f^{-1}$ undoes $f$: it takes outputs of $f$ back to their corresponding inputs. In other words, $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ and $f(f^{-1}(x))$. This is why we need $f$ to be one-to-one: if two different $x$-values get sent to the same $y$-value, then the inverse function won&#x2019;t know which one to send that $y$-value back to.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	inverse function
	
	The inverse to $f(x) = x^5$ is $f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt[5]{y}$, and the inverse to $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{y}$.
