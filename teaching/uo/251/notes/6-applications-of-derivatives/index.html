For some functions, we understand their rate of change as its own concept &mdash; the derivative of position is velocity, and we don&#x2019;t need any metaphors to understand what a velocity function measures &mdash; it&#x2019;s just speed in a certain direction. On the other hand, if we have a function $ P(t) $ that gives population of a city after $ t $ years of measurement, what exactly is $ P'(t) $ doing? We&#x2019;ve mentioned in class that it has units of people per year, but unlike velocity, which we understand in its own right, we don&#x2019;t have a preconceived notion of what the instantaneous rate of change of population <em>means</em>. Thankfully, there is a sense in which we can understand it a little bit more easily.</p><p class="body-text">The derivative $ f'(a) $ is the slope of a tangent line, which is just rise over run. When run is exactly $ 1 $, the slope is just the rise. Since the tangent line by definition touches the graph at $ (a, f(a)) $, the tangent line can&#x2019;t get <em>that</em> far away from the graph when $ x $ increases by just $ 1 $. In total, the derivative $ f'(a) $ is approximately the difference between $ f(a) $ and $ f(a + 1) $.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="derivative-interpretation" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Here, the two red points indicate show where the tangent line predicts the point on the graph will be, and also where it actually is. When $ a = 0 $, $ g'(a) = -\frac{1}{2} $, so $ g(1) - g(0) \approx -\frac{1}{2} $. In reality, it&#x2019;s actually $ -\frac{3}{8} $, but that&#x2019;s not too far off. The point is this:</p><p class="body-text">$$g'(x) \approx g(x + 1) - g(x).$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">For our population example, $ P'(t) $ is approximately the amount the population increased between years $ t $ and $ t + 1 $.</p><p class="body-text">We don&#x2019;t just need to make the run exactly $ 1 $, either. If it is $ a $, then we get the following approximation:</p><p class="body-text">$$a \cdot g'(x) \approx g(x + a) - g(x).$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">Therefore, $ g(x + a) \approx g(x) + a \cdot g(x) $. For example, if the population in our town is $ 1000 $ in the year $ 2010 $, then $ P(2010) = 1000 $. Then if $ P'(2010) = 500 $, the population will increase by approximately $ 500 $ by $ 2011 $. Similarly, we expect that the population was about $ 750 $ half a year after $ 2009 $, $ 500 $ in $ 2009 $, and so on.</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Average Velocity</h2><section><p class="body-text">We&#x2019;ve already seen how derivatives relate to position, velocity, and acceleration: if those functions are given by $ s(t) $, $ v(t) $, and $ a(t) $ respectively, then $ v(t) = s'(t) $ and $ a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t) $. One more thing to mention is <strong>average velocity</strong>, which is defined to just be the change in position between two points in time, divided by the change in time.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: average velocity</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $ s(t) $ be the position of an object at time $ t $. The <strong>average velocity</strong> between times $ t = a $ and $ t = b $ is</p><p class="body-text">$$v_{avg} = \frac{s(b) - s(a)}{b - a}.$$</p><p class="body-text"></p></div><p class="body-text">This is how you probably approximate velocity in your head: if a car drives 45 miles in half in hour, it&#x2019;s probably going about 90 miles an hour. The way we make that formal is with average velocity: over those 30 minutes, the car&#x2019;s average velocity is 90 miles per hour.</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Tangent Line Equations</h2><section><p class="body-text">Another small topic to cover: the derivative of a function gives the slope of a tangent line, but what about the equation of that line? For that, we can use <strong>point-slope form:</strong> the equation of a line with slope $ m $ passing through the point $ (x_0, y_0) $ is $ y = y_0 + m(x - x_0) $. When $ x = a $, the tangent line to the graph of $ f(x) $ passes through $ (a, f(a)) $ and has slope $ f'(a) $, which means:</p><div class="notes-prop notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-prop-title">Proposition: tangent line equation</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $ f $ be a function differentiable at $ x = a $. Then the equation of the tangent line to $ f $ at $ x = a $ is</p><p class="body-text">$$y = f(a) + f'(a) \cdot (x - a).$$</p><p class="body-text"></p></div></section><h2 class="section-text"> Applications to Business</h2><section><p class="body-text">One last handful of applications: we can apply derivatives to some functions used in business and economics. We need a few quick definitions first. If we&#x2019;re selling items for profit, the cost function $ C(x) $ gives the total cost to <strong>us</strong> for aquiring $ x $ items &mdash; not the selling price, but the cost we pay to get the supply. Similarly, $ R(x) $ is the revenue we receive from selling $ x $ items. Finally, $ P(x) $ is the profit we make from selling $ x $ items &mdash; so $ P(x) = R(x) - C(x) $.</p><p class="body-text">Of particular use to us are the derivatives of these functions. In the terminology of business applications, we call these <strong>marginal functions</strong>. The marginal cost function is $ MC(x) = C'(x) $, and similarly for the marginal revenue and profit functions, $ MR(x) = R'(x) $ and $ MP(x) = P'(x) $. Using the interpretation of the derivative from earlier in the section, these marginal functions are approximately the cost, revenue, and profit we get from selling item number $ x + 1 $. For example,</p><p class="body-text">$$MC(4) = C'(4) \approx C(5) - C(4),$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">which is the cost to us to acquire the fifth item.</p><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: business applications</span></p><p class="body-text">You&#x2019;re selling whiteboard markers. When you sell $ x $ of them, you charge $ p(x) = 1 - .01x $ dollars per marker. Each one costs you $ 5 $ cents to produce. What is the profit you make from selling the 20th marker?</p><p class="body-text">The total cost to us to get $ x $ markers is $ 0.05 $ dollars per marker times $ x $ markers, so $ C(x) = .05x $. Similarly,</p><p class="body-text">$$R(x) = x \cdot p(x) = x - .01x^2,$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">so</p><p class="body-text">$$P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = .95x - .01x^2.$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">Now we need to compute</p><p class="body-text">$$MP(x) = P'(x) = .95 - .02x.$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">Therefore, the profit from item 20 is</p><p class="body-text">$$MP(19) = .95 - .38 = .57,$$</p><p class="body-text"></p><p class="body-text">so we make a profit of $ 57 $ cents from that particular marker.</p></div><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script>
