	While we&#x2019;ve touched on a few applications of derivatives so far, let&#x2019;s take a section to talk about a handful more. This won&#x2019;t take us an incredibly long time, but there are some important points we haven&#x2019;t touched on yet.
	
	The most important thing to mention is an alternate way to interpret derivatives. For some functions, we understand their rate of change as its own concept &mdash; the derivative of position is velocity, and we don&#x2019;t need any metaphors to understand what a velocity function measures &mdash; it&#x2019;s just speed in a certain direction. On the other hand, if we have a function $P(t)$ that gives population of a city after $t$ years of measurement, what exactly is $P'(t)$ doing? We&#x2019;ve mentioned in class that it has units of people per year, but unlike velocity, which we understand in its own right, we don&#x2019;t have a preconceived notion of what the instantaneous rate of change of population <em>means</em>. Thankfully, there is a sense in which we can understand it a little bit more easily.
	
	The derivative $f'(a)$ is the slope of a tangent line, which is just rise over run. When run is exactly $1$, the slope is just the rise. Since the tangent line by definition touches the graph at $(a, f(a))$, the tangent line can&#x2019;t get <em>that</em> far away from the graph when $x$ increases by just $1$. In total, the derivative $f'(a)$ is approximately the difference between $f(a)$ and $f(a + 1)$.

	Here, the two green points indicate show where the tangent line predicts the point on the graph will be, and also where it actually is. When $a = 0$, $g'(a) = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $g(1) - g(0) \approx -\frac{1}{2}$. In reality, it&#x2019;s actually $-\frac{3}{8}$, but that&#x2019;s not too far off. The point is this: $g'(x) \approx g(x + 1) - g(x)$. For our population example, $P'(t)$ is approximately the amount the population increased between years $t$ and $t + 1$.
	
	We don&#x2019;t just need to make the run exactly $1$, either. If it is $a$, then we get the following approximation:
	
	$$
		a \cdot g'(x) \approx g(x + a) - g(x).
	$$
	
	Therefore, $g(x + a) \approx g(x) + a \cdot g(x)$. For example, if the population in our town is $1000$ in the year $2010$, then $P(2010) = 1000$. Then if $P'(2010) = 500$, the population will increase by approximately $500$ by $2011$. Similarly, we expect that the population was about $750$ half a year after $2009$, $500$ in $2009$, and so on.

!text s Average Velocity

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	We&#x2019;ve already talked about how derivatives relate to position, velocity, and acceleration: if those functions are given by $s(t)$, $v(t)$, and $a(t)$ respectively, then $v(t) = s'(t)$ and $a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)$. One more thing to mention is <dfn>average velocity</dfn>, which is defined to just be the change in position between two points in time, divided by the change in time.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	average velocity
	
	Let $s(t)$ be the position of an object at time $t$. The <dfn>average velocity</dfn> between times $t = a$ and $t = b$ is
	
	$$
		v_{avg} = \frac{s(b) - s(a)}{b - a}.
	$$
	
!end-def




!begin-text-block
	
	This is how you probably approximate velocity in your head: if a car drives 45 miles in half in hour, it&#x2019;s probably going about 90 miles an hour. The way we make that formal is with average velocity: over those 30 minutes, the car&#x2019;s average velocity is 90 miles per hour.

!text s Tangent Line Equations

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Another small topic to cover: the derivative of a function gives the slope of a tangent line, but what about the equation of that line? For that, we can use <dfn>point-slope form:</dfn> the equation of a line with slope $m$ passing through the point $(x_0, y_0)$ is $y = y_0 + m(x - x_0)$. When $x = a$, the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(a, f(a))$ and has slope $f'(a)$, which means:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	tangent line equation
	
	Let $f$ be a function differentiable at $x = a$. Then the equation of the tangent line to $f$ at $x = a$ is
	
	$$
		y = f(a) + f'(a) \cdot (x - a).
	$$
	
!end-prop

!text s Applications to Business

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	One last handful of applications: we can apply derivatives to some functions used in business and economics. We need a few quick definitions first. If we are selling items for profit, the cost function $C(x)$ gives the total cost to <strong>us</strong> for aquiring $x$ items &mdash; not the selling price, but the cost we pay to get the supply. Similarly, $R(x)$ is the revenue we receive from selling $x$ items. Finally, $P(x)$ is the profit we make from selling $x$ items &mdash; so $P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$.
	
	Of particular use to us are the derivatives of these functions. In the terminology of business applications, we call these <dfn>marginal functions</dfn>. The marginal cost function is $MC(x) = C'(x)$, and similarly for the marginal revenue and profit functions, $MR(x)$ and $MP(x)$. Using the interpretation of the derivative from earlier in the section, these marginal functions are approximately the cost, revenue, and profit we get from selling item number $x + 1$. For example, $MC(4) = C'(4) \approx C(5) - C(4)$, which is the cost to us to acquire the fifth item.

!begin-example

	business applications
	
	You&#x2019;re selling whiteboard markers. When you sell $x$ of them, you charge $p(x) = 1 - .01x$ dollars per marker. Each one costs you $5$ cents to produce. What is the profit you make from selling the 20th marker?
	
	The total cost to us to get $x$ markers is $\$0.05$ per marker times $x$ markers, so $C(x) = .05x$. Similarly, $R(x) = x \cdot p(x) = x - .01x^2$. Then $P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = .95x - .01x^2$. We need to compute $MP(x) = P'(x) = .95 - .02x$. Then the profit from item 20 is $MP(19) = .95 - .38 = .57$. Therefore, we make a profit of $57$ cents from that particular marker.
