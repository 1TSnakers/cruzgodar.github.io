	Now that we&#x2019;ve talked about limits, let&#x2019;s return to the idea we discussed in section 1: the slopes of curves. As a reminder, the slope of a curve at $x = a$ is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at $x = a$. In order to calculate this slope, we first find the slope of secant lines, which is just rise over run. If one point of the line is taken at $x = a$ and the other is taken at $x = a + h$, then the run is $h$ and the rise is $f(a + h) - f(a)$, so the slope is just
	
	$$
		\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
	$$

	We want to get the tangent line by setting $h = 0$, but since the slope will be $\frac{0}{0}$ then, we need to take a limit instead.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop

	Let $f$ be a function that is continuous at $x = a$. Then the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x = a$ is
	
	$$
		\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
	$$

!end-prop



!begin-example
	
	slope of a graph
	
	Find the slope of the function $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 1$.
	
	By the definition, we have that the slope is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(1 + h) - f(1)}{h} &= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{(1 + h)^2 - (1)^2}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(1 + 2h + h^2) - 1}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2h + h^2}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0} (2 + h).
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	That last line is justified, since we can cancel common factors in limits. Finishing up, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{h \to 0} (2 + h) &= 2 + 0\\
			&= 2.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	This tells us that the slope of the graph (i.e. the slope of the tangent line) at $x = 1$ is $2$.

	slope of a graph
	
	Find the slope of the function $g(x) = x^3$ at $x = -2$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	We mentioned in section 1 that the slope of a tangent line measures rate of change of a function: for example, the rate of change of position is velocity. This idea is so important and used so often that we want to give it a name and simple notation, so that we don&#x2019;t have to write down whole sentences to explain what we mean every time.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	derivative
	
	Let $f$ be a function defined in an interval containing $x = a$, including at $a$ itself. The <dfn>derivative</dfn> of $f$ at $a$, written $f'(a)$ and read $f$ prime of $a$, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $x = a$. In other words,
	
	$$
		f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
	$$
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	We use the notation $f'(a)$ because the derivative is a whole new function: $f'(x)$ outputs the slope of the graph of $f$ at the point $x$. Taking a derivative is called <dfn>differentiating</dfn>, not deriving, for some reason.
	
	One more notational quirk: sometimes, we don&#x2019;t want to give a function a name just so that we can put a prime on it to indicate that we want to take a derivative. In that case, we can just write $\frac{d}{dx}$ followed by the function in brackets: for example, $\frac{d}{dx}[x^2]$ means the derivative of $x^2$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	computing a derivative
	
	Find $\frac{d}{dx}[x^2]$.
	
	By definition, this is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}\\
			 &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h}\\
			 &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh + h^2}{h}\\
			 &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(2x + h)}{h}\\
			 &= \lim_{h \to 0} (2x + h)\\
			 &= 2x.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, $\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = 2x$.
