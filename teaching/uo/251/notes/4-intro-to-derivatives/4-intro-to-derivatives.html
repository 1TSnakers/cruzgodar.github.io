	Now that we&#x2019;ve talked about limits, let&#x2019;s return to the idea we discussed in section 1: the slopes of curves. As a reminder, the slope of a curve at $x = a$ is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at $x = a$. In order to calculate this slope, we first find the slope of secant lines, which is just rise over run. If one point of the line is taken at $x = a$ and the other is taken at $x = a + h$, then the run is $h$ and the rise is $f(a + h) - f(a)$, so the slope is just
	
	$$
		\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
	$$

	We want to get the tangent line by setting $h = 0$, but since the slope will be $\frac{0}{0}$ then, we need to take a limit instead.

!begin-prop

	Let $f$ be a function that is continuous at $x = a$. Then the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x = a$ is
	
	$$
		\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.
	$$

!end-prop



!begin-example
	
	slope of a graph
	
	Find the slope of the function $f(x) = x^2$ at $x = 1$.
	
	By the definition, we have that the slope is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(1 + h) - f(1)}{h} &= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{(1 + h)^2 - (1)^2}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{(1 + 2h + h^2) - 1}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{2h + h^2}{h}\\
			&= \lim_{h \to 0^+} (2 + h).
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	That last line is justified, since we can cancel common factors in limits. Finishing up, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{h \to 0^+} (2 + h) &= 2 + 0\\
			&= 2.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	This tells us that the slope of the graph (i.e. the slope of the tangent line) at $x = 1$ is $2$.
