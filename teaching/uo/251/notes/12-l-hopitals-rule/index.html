	It&#x2019;s time to take a brief detour from furthering our understanding of derivatives to return to limits &mdash; some of them that were annoying to calculate before have very easy solutions with a single rule in terms of derivatives.
	
	Let&#x2019;s recap a little. Since most common functions are continuous where they are defined, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ is very often just $f(a)$. The main times when this is not the case are the following: first, $f$ is a piecewise-defined function that changes definition at $a$, so we need to deal with both the one-sided limits. A second possibility is that $f(a)$ involves division by zero, in which case the limit is typically $\infty$ or $-\infty$. Finally, $f(a)$ is in some kind of form like $\frac{0}{0}$, which usually means that the limit is actually a number that we can find by simplifying the expression somehow. Unfortunately, that simplification is often annoying or difficult or both, and any improvement on this would be great. This third case is what we&#x2019;ll be tackling, and the first thing to do is to give names to the kind of forms like $\frac{0}{0}$.

!begin-def
	
	indeterminate form
	
	A limit is in <dfn>indeterminate form</dfn> if it ends up in any of the following forms:
	
	1. $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$.
	
	2. $0 \cdot \infty$.
	
	3. $\infty - \infty$.
	
	4. $1^\infty$, $\infty^0$, or $0^0$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	First, let&#x2019;s talk about type 1. This will be the simplest type for us to handle, and thankfully, the rule is simple to write down.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule
	
	Suppose $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Then
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	In other words, if you&#x2019;re getting $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ out of a limit, differentiate the top and bottom and try again. Two very important things to note: first of all, you can only do this if the limit is of one of those two forms &mdash; although it&#x2019;d be nice to be able to differentiate the top and bottom of any limit, it only works for these. Secondly, we&#x2019;re <strong>not</strong> using the quotient rule here: the top and bottom of the fraction get differentiated separately.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule
	
	Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$.
	
	You might recall that this one gave us some trouble back in the first few sections. Since both $x$ and $\sin(x)$ are continuous functions, we have that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \frac{\sin(0)}{0} = \frac{0}{0}$. That means we can use L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule to try evaluating a different limit and see if we have more success.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} &= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]}{\frac{d}{dx}[x]}\\
			&= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1}\\
			&= \lim_{x \to 0} \cos(x)\\
			&= \cos(0)\\
			&= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Much easier than this process used to be!

!begin-exercise
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule
	
	Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3 + 3x^2 + x}{\ln(x)}$. 
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	In order to apply L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule to the other indeterminate forms, we just need to get them in one of the two forms the rule applies to. Let&#x2019;s start wth type 2 and work our way down.
	
	If $\lim_{x \to a} (f(x)g(x)) = 0 \cdot \infty$ since $f(x) \to 0$ and $g(x) \to \infty$, then we have two options. First, since $\frac{1}{g(x)} \to 0$, we can rewrite the limit as $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{1/g(x)}$, which will then be in the form $\frac{0}{0}$. Alternatively, since $\frac{1}{f(x)} \to \infty$ or $-\infty$, we can rewrite the original limit as $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{g(x)}{1/f(x)}$, which will then be in the form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Either way, L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule will apply.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule in the case $0 \cdot \infty$
	
	Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} (2x - 4)\ln(2x - 4)$.
	
	We have $2x - 4 \to 0$ and $\ln(2x - 4) \to -\infty$, so this limit is of the form $0 \cdot \infty$. We can either move $2x - 4$ or $\ln(2x - 4)$ into the denominator &mdash; let&#x2019;s try the natural log and see how it goes.
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to 2} (2x - 4)\ln(2x - 4) = \frac{2x - 4}{\frac{1}{\ln(2x-4)}}.
	$$
	
	We need to differentiate the top and bottom here. The derivative of $2x - 4$ is just $2$, but $\frac{1}{\ln(2x-4)}$ is a quotient rule problem (or a chain rule one, depending on how you approach it). We have
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{1}{\ln(2x-4)} \right] = \frac{-\frac{2}{2x - 4}}{\ln^2(2x - 4)},
	$$
	
	which is looking significantly more complicated. We&#x2019;ll probably have to run L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule one more time at the very least, and there&#x2019;s no guarantee it will get simpler. Instead, let&#x2019;s go back and try the other route.
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to 2} (2x - 4)\ln(2x - 4) = \frac{\ln(2x-4)}{\frac{1}{2x - 4}}.
	$$
	
	Now this is much easier to deal with. We have $\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(2x - 4)] = \frac{2}{2x - 4}$ and $\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{1}{2x - 4}\right] = \frac{-2}{(2x - 4)^2}$. Therefore, the limit becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{x \to 2} (2x - 4)\ln(2x - 4) &= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{\frac{2}{2x - 4}}{\frac{-2}{(2x - 4)^2}}\\
			&= \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{2(2x - 4)^2}{-2(2x - 4)}\\
			&= \lim_{x \to 2} -(2x - 4)\\
			&= -(2\cdot 0 - 4)\\
			&= 0.
		\end{align*}	
	$$
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	We handle the $\infty - \infty$ case similarly: we first force both terms to be fractions, then combine them with common denominators in order to apply L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-exercise
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule in the case $\infty - \infty$
	
	Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} + \ln(x)$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	The final type of indeterminate form involves exponents. To handle these, we follow a process reminiscent of logarithmic differentiation: for $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)^{g(x)}$, we set $y = f(x)^{g(x)}$, take the natural log of both sides to get $\ln(y) = g(x) \ln(f(x))$, and then evaluate the limit on the right, possibly with L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule. Since $\ln$ is continuous, $\lim_{x \to a} \ln(y) = \ln(\lim_{x \to a} y)$, so once we&#x2019;ve found the limit on the right side, all we need to do is raise $e$ to that power to find the original limit we were looking for.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule in the case $1^\infty$
	
	Evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + e^{-x})^{x}$.
	
	Since $e^{-x} \to 0$ and $x \to \infty$, this thing is of the form $1^\infty$. So let&#x2019;s set $y = (1 + e^{-x})^{x}$ and take a natural log to get $\ln(y) = x\ln(1 + e^{-x})$. Now since $\ln(1) = 0$ and $\ln$ is continuous, $\ln(1 + e^{-x}) \to 0$, so the whole limit is now of the form $\infty \cdot 0$. We&#x2019;ll tackle this just like we did before. We learned our lesson about putting the $\ln$ in the denominator, so let&#x2019;s try the $x$ first this time. We get
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} x\ln(1 + e^{-x}) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(1 + e^{-x})}{1/x}.
	$$
	
	Since this is of the form $\frac{0}{0}$, we can differentiate top and bottom to get 
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{x \to \infty} x\ln(1 + e^{-x}) &= \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{-1}{1 + e^{-x}} \cdot e^{-x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}\\
			&= \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-x}}.
		\end{align*}	
	$$
	
	Unfortunately, we&#x2019;re not quite done yet. While the denominator limits to $1$, the numerator is another case of $0 \cdot \infty$, since $x^2 \to \infty$ and $e^{-x} \to 0$. The easiest way to rewrite this as something that L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule can handle is to move the $e^{-x}$ to the denominator to make it have a positive exponent:
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2e^{-x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}.
	$$
	
	Now this is of the form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, so we can differentiate top and bottom as usual.
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x}.
	$$
	
	Still $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, so let&#x2019;s use L&#x2019;H&#244;pital&#x2019;s rule again.
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2}{e^x}.
	$$
	
	At long last, this is just $0$, since $e^x \to \infty$. Therefore, we have
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-x}} = \frac{0}{1} = 0,
	$$
	
	and so
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln(y) = \lim_{x \to \infty} x\ln(1 + e^{-x}) = 0.
	$$
	
	As mentioned, we can move the limit on the left inside the $\ln$ and then exponentiate both sides to finally get that
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + e^{-x})^{x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} y = e^0 = 1.
	$$
