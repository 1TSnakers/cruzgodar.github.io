You&#x2019;re viewing the interactive lecture notes &mdash; reading either these or the textbook is required for the class, since we&#x2019;ll have a very short reading quiz on Canvas due before each lecture. To get started, let&#x2019;s make sure your browser handles equations and graphs correctly. You should see an equation on its own line below and a graph below that.</p><p class="body-text">$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="test-graph" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">If anything doesn&#x2019;t appear correctly, update your browser and then reach out if that doesn&#x2019;t work. There&#x2019;s also a non-interactive pdf version of each document available for compatibility &mdash; let me know if you need them.</p><br></section><section><h2 class="section-text">Algebra</h2><br><p class="body-text">A <dfn>function</dfn> is a rule that associates a set of inputs with a set of outputs. As with the previous few math classes you&#x2019;ve likely taken, the functions we&#x2019;re most interested in have real numbers as both their inputs and outputs, and we can represent them with graphs &mdash; for example, the function $f(x) = x^2$ squares whatever number is plugged into it, and its graph is a parabola.</p><br><div class="desmos-border"><div id="functions" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">A handful of the other functions whose graphs you should know are also plotted there &mdash; click the empty circles to the left of the equations to toggle them on one-by-one and have a look at the graphs.</p><br><p class="body-text">The <dfn>domain</dfn> of a function is the set of numbers we can plug into it. For example, the domain of $y = \sqrt{x}$ is $[0, \infty)$, since we can take the square root of any nonnegative real number and get a sensible result. On the other hand, the domain of $y = x^2$ is $(-\infty, \infty)$, since any real number can be squared. On a graph, the domain is the part of the $x$-axis that has the graph above it.</p><br></section><section><h2 class="section-text">Trigonometry</h2><br><p class="body-text">The <dfn>unit circle</dfn> is the circle with radius $1$ centered at $(0, 0)$. Given an angle $\theta$ measured counter-clockwise from the positive $x$-axis, we define $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$ to be the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the point on the unit circle with that angle.</p><br><div class="desmos-border"><div id="trig-review" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Try sliding the value of $t$ (representing $\theta$) around. Since radians run from $0$ to $2\pi$ to complete one revolution around the circle, we have that $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1$ and $\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0$, for example. If we graph $y = \sin(x)$ and $y = \cos(\theta)$, we get wave-like graphs.</p><br><div class="desmos-border"><div id="trig-graphs" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Also present in the graph are $\tan(x)$, $\csc(x)$, $\sec(x)$, and $\cot(x)$, which are defined in the following ways:</p><br><p class="body-text">1. $\tan(x) = \dfrac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$</p><br><p class="body-text">2. $\csc(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sin(x)}$</p><br><p class="body-text">3. $\sec(x) = \dfrac{1}{\cos(x)}$</p><br><p class="body-text">4. $\cot(x) = \dfrac{1}{\tan(x)}$</p><br><p class="body-text">Along with sine and cosine, these make up the six main trig functions.</p><br><p class="body-text">These are the main concepts we&#x2019;ll need from algebra and trig, but there are a handful of others we&#x2019;ll periodically find necessary, like factoring polynomials and evaluating trig functions. If you&#x2019;re feeling rusty on any of what we&#x2019;ve looked at in this very brief review, please come to office hours in week 1! We&#x2019;ll make sure you get off to a good start.</p><br><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script>if (typeof Page === "undefined"){if (window.location.search !== ""){window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname) + "&" + window.location.search.slice(1));}else{window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname));}}Page.settings = {"title": "Section 0: Algebra and Trig Review","math_page": true,"small_margins_on_ultrawide": true,"parent_list": "/teaching/uo/251/notes"};Page.load();</script>
