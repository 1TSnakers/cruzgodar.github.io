!header Section 3: Continuity

!nav-buttons



!begin-text-block
	
	We&#x2019;ve informally defined $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ as being the value we would expect $f(a)$ to be, regardless of what $f(a)$ actually is, or even if it&#x2019;s defined at all. When the value we expect to be there is what&#x2019;s actually there, we have a special term for the function.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	continuity
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function. If $f(a)$ is defined and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$, then we say that $f$ is <dfn>continuous at $a$</dfn>. If $f$ is continuous at all $a$ in its domain, then we just say that $f$ is <dfn>continuous</dfn>.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	The simplest way to describe continuous functions is that they&#x2019;re the ones whose graphs can be drawn in one stroke without lifting your pen from the paper. If a function is not continuous at $x = a$, then there are only a few possibilites for what went wrong:
	
	1. $\displaystyle f(a)$ is undefined.
	
	2. $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ DNE.
	
	3. $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and $\displaystyle f(a)$ is defined, but $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	continuity
	
	Let $f$ be defined by the following graph. Where is $f$ continuous?
	
	!desmos continuity-example
	
	This function has three kinds of discontinuities: at $x = -3$, $f(-3) = -1$ but $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x)$ DNE, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there. At $x = 0$, $f(0) = 1$, but $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 0$, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there either. Finally, at $x = 4$, $f(4)$ is undefined, and $\lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = \infty$, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there. In total, $f$ is continuous everywhere except for $x = -3$, $x = 0$, and $x = 4$.

!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	continuity
	
	Define a function $f$ by
	
	$$
		f(x) = \begin{cases}
			\frac{\sin(x)}{x}, & x \neq 0\\
			1, & x = 0
		\end{cases}.	
	$$
	
	Show that $f$ is continuous.	

!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	The function in the previous example displays three common kinds of discontinuities: to make things easier when talking about them, let&#x2019;s give them names.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	discontinuities
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function such that $f(a)$ is defined but $f$ is discontinuous at $x = a$.
	
	1. If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and is finite, we call this a <dfn>removable</dfn> discontinuity, since by changing just that one point, we can make the function continuous.
	
	2. If $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ exist but are not equal, we call this a <dfn>jump</dfn> discontinuity, since the function &#x201C;jumps&#x201D; from one point to another.
	
	3. If one or both of the one-sided limits is $\pm \infty$, we call this an <dfn>infinite</dfn> discontinuity, since the function approaches an infinite value.
	
	These don&#x2019;t describe all possible kinds of discontinuities &mdash; for example, $\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ has a discontinuity at $0$ that doesn&#x2019;t fall into any of these categories.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	In the previous example, $f(x)$ has a removable discontinuity at $x = 0$, a jump discontinuity at $x = -3$, and an infinite discontinuity at $x = 4$.
	
	The next two theorems will let calculate limits <strong>much</strong> more easily. The first one is great news: most of the functions we know so far are continuous wherever they&#x2019;re defined!
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	continuity of elementary functions
	
	Polynomials, rational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions are all continuous everywhere they&#x2019;re defined.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	This next theorem tells us that continuity is preserved through composition.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	continuity of compositions
	
	Let $f$ and $g$ be functions so that $g$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$. Then $f(g(x))$ is continuous at $a$. In particular, if $f$ and $g$ are simply continuous functions, then $f(g(x))$ is continuous too.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	an easier limit
	
	Find 
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x^2) - x}{2 - \tan(x)}.
	$$
	
	Since all of the functions present are continuous &mdash; including the compositions like $\cos(x^2)$, we can just plug in $x = 0$:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x^2) - x}{2 - \tan(x)} &= \frac{\cos(0^2) - 0}{2 - \tan(0)}\\
			&= \frac{1 - 0}{2 - 0}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	!desmos continuity-limit
	
	This is a really complicated-looking function, and it&#x2019;s nice to be able to calculate a limit of it without making a table or writing out long-winded limit rules. The only place we can&#x2019;t plug in a value of $x$ to take a limit is when it would make the denominator zero, since then the entire function is undefined and therefore not continuous.

!text s The Intermediate Value Theorem

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	We have one last theorem to talk about in this section. The result sounds a little confusing at first, but it&#x2019;s just a way to formally state what we mean when we say that continuous functions are the ones that can be drawn without lifting your pencil.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	the Intermediate Value Theorem
	
	Let $f$ be a continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and let $y$ be a number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there is a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ so that $f(c) = y$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block

	The IVT says that the graph of $f$ has complete coverage of all the $y$-values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
	
	!desmos ivt-example
	
	Here, $a = 1$ and $b = 3$. Plotted are three examples of continuous functions satisfying $f(a) = 2$ and $f(b) = 1$. No matter what function we pick, it must pass through all the $y$-values between $2$ and $1$ on its way from $a$ to $b$. It may pass through more, like $h$ does, but it needs to at least cover all the $y$-values in between.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	the Intermediate Value Theorem
	
	Show that $f(x) = x - \cos(x)$ has at least one zero.
	
	This is a pretty interesting question &mdash; how are you supposed to find a value of $x$ that makes $x = \cos(x)$? The answer is... you don&#x2019;t. Rather than find a particular value that works, we&#x2019;ll use the IVT to show that one must exist, even if we can&#x2019;t say exactly what it is. Looking back at the theorem statement, we want to pick two points, one with a $y$-value larger than $0$, and the other with a $y$-value less than $0$. Then the IVT will guarantee a point in-between them with $y$-value equal to zero. Let&#x2019;s try some sample values. $x = 0$ gives us $0 - \cos(0) = -1$, and $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, the next value that produces a simple output from cosine, gives us $\frac{\pi}{2} - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Since $0$ is a $y$-value in-between those, the IVT guarantees an $x$-value between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with $x - \cos(x) = 0$.

!section

!text s Limits to Infinity

<br>



!begin-text-block

	We have one last topic to mention before we&#x2019;re done with limits: rather than letting $x$ approach a number, we can let it get larger or smaller forever. We write this as
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)
	$$
	
	and
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x).
	$$	
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	a limit to infinity
	
	Find $\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2$.
	
	As $x$ gets larger and larger, so does $x^2$, so $\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2 = \infty$.
	
!end-example

!begin-example
	
	a limit to infinity
	
	Find $\lim_{x \to -\infty} \sin(x)$.
	
	As $x$ gets more and more and negative, $\sin(x)$ oscillates between $1$ and $-1$ faster and faster, so it never converges to a single value. Therefore, $\lim_{x \to -\infty} \sin(x)$ DNE.
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block

	In the specific case of rational functions, we know the behavior of limits to infinity very well.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def

	degree and leading coefficient

	Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial. The <dfn>degree</dfn> of $p$, written $\deg(p)$, is the largest exponent on $x$. The <dfn>leading term</dfn> of $p$ is the term with the largest exponent.
	
!end-def



!begin-example

	degree and leading coefficient
	
	The degree of $-4x^3 + 2x + 1$ is $3$, and the leading term is $-4x^3$.
	
!end-example



!begin-thm
	
	limits of rational functions to infinity
	
	Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be polynomials. Then
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)},
	$$
	
	where $P(x)$ is the leading term of $p(x)$ and $Q(x)$ is the leading term of $q(x)$. Note: this only works when limiting to $\infty$ or $-\infty$, and not to any other number!
	
!end-thm



!begin-example

	limits of rational functions to infinity
	
	Find $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2x^3 + 2x - 1}{-3x}$.
	
	Since this is a rational function being limited to infinity, we can drop everything but the leading terms:
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x^3}{-3x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x^2}{-3} = -\infty.
	$$	
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise

	limits of rational functions to infinity
	
	Find $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{6x^2 + 2x - 1}{4x^2}$.
