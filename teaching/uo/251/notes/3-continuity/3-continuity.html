!begin-text-block
	
	We&#x2019;ve informally defined $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ as being the value we would expect $f(a)$ to be, regardless of what $f(a)$ actually is, or even if it&#x2019;s defined at all. When the value we expect to be there is actually what&#x2019;s there, we have a special term for the function.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	continuity
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function. If $f(a)$ is defined and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$, then we say that $f$ is <dfn>continuous at $a$</dfn>. If $f$ is continuous at all $a$ in its domain, then we just say that $f$ is <dfn>continuous</dfn>.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	The simplest way to describe continuous functions is that they&#x2019;re the ones whose graphs can be drawn in one stroke without lifting your pen from the paper. If a function is not continuous at $x = a$, then there are only a few possibilites for what went wrong:
	
	1. $f(a)$ is undefined.
	
	2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ DNE.
	
	3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and $f(a)$ is defined, but $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) \neq f(a)$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	continuity
	
	Let $f$ be defined by the following graph. Where is $f$ continuous?
	
	!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dxsxmhf20z
	
	This function has three kinds of discontinuities: at $x = -3$, $f(-3) = -1$ but $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x)$ DNE, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there. At $x = 0$, $f(0) = 1$, but $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 0$, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there either. Finally, at $x = 4$, $f(4)$ is undefined, and $\lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = \infty$, so it&#x2019;s not continuous there. In total, $f$ is continuous everywhere except for $x = -3$, $x = 0$, and $x = 4$.

!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	continuity
	
	Define a function $f$ by
	
	$$
		f(x) = \begin{cases}
			\frac{\sin(x)}{x}, & x \neq 0\\
			1, & x = 0
		\end{cases}.	
	$$
	
	Show that $f$ is continuous.

	The function in the previous example displays all possible kinds of discontinuities: to make things easier when talking about them, let&#x2019;s give them names.

!begin-def
	
	discontinuities
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function such that $f(a)$ is defined but $f$ is discontinuous at $x = a$. This discontinuity has one of three forms:
	
	1. If $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and is finite, we call this a <dfn>removable</dfn> discontinuity, since by changing just that one point, we can make the function continuous.
	
	2. If $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ exist but are not equal, we call this a <dfn>jump</dfn> discontinuity, since the function &#x201C;jumps&#x201D; from one point to another.
	
	3. If one or both of the one-sided limits is $\pm \infty$, we call this an <dfn>infinite</dfn> discontinuity, since the function approaches an infinite value.

!begin-text-block
	
	These next two theorems will let calculate limits <strong>much</strong> more easily. The first one  is great news: most of the functions we know so far are continuous wherever they&#x2019;re defined!
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	continuity of elementary functions
	
	Polynomials, rational functions, trig functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions are all continuous everywhere they&#x2019;re defined.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	This next theorem tells us that continuity is preserved through composition.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	continuity of compositions
	
	Let $f$ and $g$ be functions so that $g$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$. Then $f(g(x))$ is continuous at $a$. In particular, if $f$ and $g$ are simply continuous functions, then $f(g(x))$ is continuous too.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	an easier limit
	
	Find 
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x^2) - x}{2 - \tan(x)}.
	$$
	
	Since all of the functions present are continuous, we can just plug in $x = 0$:
	
	$$
		\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x^2) - x}{2 - \tan(x)} = \frac{\cos(0^2) - 0}{2 - \tan(0)} = \frac{1 - 0}{2 - 0} = \frac{1}{2}.
	$$

	This is a really complicated-looking function, and it&#x2019;s nice to be able to calculate a limit of it without making a table or writing out long-winded limit rules. The only place we can&#x2019;t plug in a value of $x$ is when it would make the denominator zero, since then the entire function is undefined and therefore not continuous.
