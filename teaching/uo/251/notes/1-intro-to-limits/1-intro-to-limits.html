	Up to this point in your experience with math, most topics and problems have probably revolved around functions. You can evaluate a function at a number, or solve for when a function is zero, or create a function to model a certain quantity. The more we use functions, though, the more certain limitations become clear. For example, if we have a function $s(t)$ that measures your position after $t$ seconds, then how do we determine your velocity $v(t)$? Knowing exactly where you are at all times $t$, we really ought to be able to tell how fast you&#x2019;re moving, but we don&#x2019;t have the tools to do that yet. If you&#x2019;re moving at a constant rate &mdash; say 2 meters per second (written $\frac{m}{s}$), then your position function $s(t)$, which just measures total distance from where you started, is a straight line with slope 2.

	The slope of a line is informally its rise over its run, and if the run is $1$, that means the slope is how much the output changes when the input increases by 1. For our position example, that&#x2019;s literally meters moved per second, which is velocity. That rise over run definition means that if we want to figure out the rate of change of a function, we should look at slopes of lines. Let&#x2019;s see how well this idea works in practice with the function $f(t) = t^2$.

!begin-text-block
	
	Here we&#x2019;re taking a slope in the same way as before: rise over run, where run is exactly $1$: we evaluate one point at $t = 0$ and another at $t = 1$. The rise is also $1$, since $f(0) = 0^2 = 0$ and $f(1) = 1^2 = 1$, and so the slope of that blue line is $\frac{1}{1} = 1$.
	
	Imagine that $f$ is measuring the distance you&#x2019;ve traveled after $t$ seconds. You start off barely moving at all, and only really pick up speed down the line. You definitely don&#x2019;t have velocity $1 \frac{m}{2}$ from the moment you start, or the graph wouldn&#x2019;t have such a slow start from the origin. So what&#x2019;s the problem with the slope we found?
	
	Fundamentally, your velocity at time $t = 0$ shouldn&#x2019;t have anything to do with your position at $t = 1$. You might speed up or slow down a lot in that intervening second &mdash; maybe you even walk bacwkward! In our case, we sped up a lot, since our position is increasing faster at $t = 1$ than $t = 0$. In order to take a better measurement, we can make the run smaller in our slope calculation: for example, if we take $t = .1$, only a tenth of a second after we start measuring, then there&#x2019;s much less time for changes in position to affect the rise of the line. As a result, we get a better approximation of the actual velocity at $t = 0$.

!begin-text-block
	
	What&#x2019;s the slope now? The rise over run calculation gives us
	
	$$
		\frac{f(.1) - f(0)}{.1 - 0} = \frac{.1^2}{.1} = .1.
	$$
	
	Better! Since our approximations improve as we have a smaller and smaller run, the best approximation &mdash; in fact, the actual velocity we&#x2019;re after &mdash; is the slope of a line with <strong>no</strong> run at all. Let&#x2019;s define a couple terms to make talking about these things easier.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	secant and tangent lines
	
	A <dfn>secant line</dfn> through a curve is a line that passes through two particular points on the curve. A <dfn>tangant line</dfn> is formed from a secant line by sliding one point until it is in the same location as the other.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	So far, we&#x2019;ve been dealing with secant lines. The two points are the highlighted ones &mdash; try dragging them! What we want is a tangent line, though, which appears when both points are at $(0, 0)$.
	
!end-text-block

!begin-text-block
	
	As you might be able to predict, that line is totally flat! So our velocity at time $t = 0$ is zero, because although we pick up speed later, we don&#x2019;t have any right at the start. If this seems a little confusing, think of dropping a ball above the ground: gravity speeds it up over time, but at the exact moment you let go, it has zero velocity.
	
	It might not seem like it, but we actually just did something really cool: we defined the slope of something that&#x2019;s not a line.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	slope of a curve
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function. The <dfn>slope</dfn> of the graph of $f$ at $x = a$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x = a$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	That wasn&#x2019;t too bad! We already have a formula for the slope of a secant line, so let&#x2019;s just plug in the same point twice to find the slope of a tangent line. So in the example we&#x2019;ve been talking about, that means plugging in $(0, 0)$ for both the left and right points:
	
	$$
		\frac{f(0) - f(0)}{0 - 0} = \frac{0}{0}.
	$$
	
	And now it all comes grinding to a halt. We can&#x2019;t divide anything by zero &mdash; even dividing zero by itself is a problem. No matter what slope we try to calculate, we&#x2019;ll have this problem, since the rise over run formula will always be $\frac{0}{0}$. So what can we do? That line <strong>has</strong> a slope &mdash; the problem isn&#x2019;t that it&#x2019;s not well-defined or something, it&#x2019;s just that we cannot calculate it with methods in math that we&#x2019;ve learned so far.
	
	It&#x2019;s important that we spell out the problem we&#x2019;re running into very clearly. Let $g(h) = \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h - 0}$, which is just the slope of a secant line passing through the points $(0, f(0))$ and $(h, f(h))$. The function $g$ is undefined at zero, but <strong>there is a clear value it should have.</strong> To illustrate what we mean, let&#x2019;s graph $g(h)$.
	
!end-text-block



!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zne3gmgazq



!begin-text-block
	
	Since $f(h) = h^2$, $g(h) = \frac{h^2}{h}$. When $h$ is nonzero, we can cancel an $h$ to get $g(h) = h$. When $h = 0$, $g$ is undefined, so there is a hole in the graph at $h = 0$. But looking at that graph, the values of the graph right around $h = 0$ are very close to $0$, and so there is a sense in which the value that $g(h)$ <strong>should</strong> have at $h = 0$ is $0$.
	
	That sense is nice, but it&#x2019;s far from being a concrete definition, and if we&#x2019;re going to find the slopes of more complicated functions than $f(t) = t^2$, we need to know exactly what we&#x2019;re going. The tool we&#x2019;ll construct for this purpose is called a <dfn>limit,</dfn> and we&#x2019;ll spend roughly the first two weeks of the course getting used to working with them. Around week 3, we&#x2019;ll return with our knowledge of limits to this tangent line business, and figure out an easier way to find the slope of a curve. For now, let&#x2019;s dive into limits.
