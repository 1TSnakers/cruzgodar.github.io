In sections 2 and 3, we introduced limit rules and continuous functions, both of which gave us tools to more easily and quickly calculate limits. After introducing derivatives in the previous section, it&#x2019;s time to improve on the initial way we calculate them (called the <strong>limit definition of the derivative</strong>). We&#x2019;ll build up a series of rules and techniques that let us differentiate many functions that were much too difficult with the limit definition.</p><p class="body-text">The derivative $f'(a)$ is just the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x = a$. If the graph of $f$ is already a horizontal line, then a tangent line at any point is just that same line, and therefore has slope zero.</p><p class="body-text">The functions whose graphs are horizontal lines are the constant functions $y = c$ for some number $c$. Since the exact value of $c$ is irrelevant, we have the result that all constant functions have derivative zero.</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: constant functions have derivative zero</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $f(x) = c$ for some constant $c$. Then $f'(x) = 0$.</p></div><p class="body-text">This is a good start! Just like we did with limits, let&#x2019;s set our sights on polynomials next. There are a couple things we&#x2019;ll have to tackle to get there: for example, $2x^2 - x$ features the terms $x^2$ and $x$, along with subtraction and multiplication by $2$. With limits, we were able to ignore almost all of that, passing them through arithmetic, powers, and roots, but derivatives won&#x2019;t be quite so fluid. Let&#x2019;s begin with terms like $x$ and $x^2$.</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: the power rule</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.</p></div><p class="body-text">In other words, to differentiate a function of the form $x^n$, bring down the power in the form of a constant multiple and decrease the power by one. The proof of this theorem is a little bit tricky &mdash; it involves expanding $(x + h)^n$ for an arbitrary integer $n$, which isn&#x2019;t particularly easy. It&#x2019;s also worth pointing out that the theorem as stated only works for positive integer powers. We&#x2019;ll later extend it to all nonzero numbers, but for now, we&#x2019;ll have to stick with positive integers.</p><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: the derivative of $x^n$</span></p><p class="body-text">Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[x^6]$.</p><p class="body-text">To find this, we bring down the $6$ and decrease it by one into a $5$, to get $\frac{d}{dx}[x^6] = 6x^5$.</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: the derivative of $x^n$</span></p><p class="body-text">Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt}[t^3]$.</p></div><p class="body-text">One of the most common mistakes made with derivatives is using the previous theorem on functions it doesn&#x2019;t apply to. For example, although $(\cos(x))^5$ looks like it might have a derivative of $5(\cos(x))^4$, but the theorem only applies to $x^5$. Later on, we&#x2019;ll see how to modify the derivative of $x^5$ to apply to similar-looking functions like this, but for now, we&#x2019;re stuck with only functions of the form $x^n$.</p><p class="body-text">Next, let&#x2019;s get the rest of the glue we need to get to polynomials &mdash; specifically, how do derivatives interact with addition, subtraction, and multiplication by constants?</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: the sum, difference, and constant multiple rules</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions and $c$ a constant number.</p><p class="body-text">1.
