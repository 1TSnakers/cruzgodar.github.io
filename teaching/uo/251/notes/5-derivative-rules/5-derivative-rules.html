!header Section 5: Derivative Rules

!text b c Covered in Week 3

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	In section 1, we introduced limits, but the way we calculated them was often tedious or difficult. In sections 2 and 3, we introduced limit rules and continuous functions, both of which gave us tools to more easily and quickly calculate limits. After introducing derivatives in the previous section, it&#x2019;s time to improve on the initial way we calculate them (called the <dfn>limit definition of the derivative</dfn>. We&#x2019;ll build up a series of rules and techniques that let us differentiate many functions that were much too difficult with the limit definition.
	
	The derivative $f'(a)$ is just the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x = a$. If the graph of $f$ is already a horizontal line, then a tangent line at any point is just that same line, and therefore has slope zero.

!begin-text-block
	
	The functions whose graphs are horizontal lines are the constant functions $y = c$ for some number $c$. Since the exact value of $c$ is irrelevant, we have the result that all constant functions have derivative zero.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	constant functions have derivative zero
	
	Let $f(x) = c$ for a constant $c$. Then $f'(x) = 0$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	This is a good start! Just like we did with limits, let&#x2019;s set our sights on polynomials next. There&#x2019;s a couple things we&#x2019;ll have to tackle to get there: for example, $2x^2 - x$ features the terms $x^2$ and $x$, along with subtraction and multiplication by $2$. With limits, we were able to ignore almost all of that, passing them through arithmetic, powers, and roots, but derivatives won&#x2019;t be quite so fluid. Let&#x2019;s begin with terms like $x$ and $x^2$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	the derivative of $x^n$
	
	Let $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.
	
	You&#x2019;ll often hear this referred to as the power rule, but in comparison to the techniques we&#x2019;ll see later in this section, which let us differentiate combinations of <strong>any</strong> two functions, this is a much more narrowly-focused theorem. For that reason, along with some common mistakes we&#x2019;ll mention later, I tend not to use that name.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	In other words, to differentiate a function of the form $x^n$, bring down the power in the form of a constant multiple and decrease the power by one. The proof of this theorem is a little bit hairy &mdash; it involves expanding $(x + h)^n$ for an arbitrary integer $n$, which is pretty tricky. It&#x2019;s also worth pointing out that the theorem as stated only works for positive integer powers. We&#x2019;ll later extend it to all nonzero numbers, but for now, we&#x2019;ll have to stick with positive integers.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	the derivative of $x^n$
	
	Find $\frac{d}{dx}[x^6]$.
	
	To find this, we bring down the $6$ and decrease it by one into a $5$, to get $\frac{d}{dx}[x^6] = 6x^5$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	the derivative of $x^n$
	
	Find $\frac{d}{dt}[t^3]$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	One of the most common mistakes made with derivatives is using the previous theorem on functions it doesn&#x2019;t apply to. For example, although $(\cos(x))^5$ looks like it might have a derivative of $5(\cos(x))^4$, but the theorem only applies to $x^5$. Later on, we&#x2019;ll see how to modify the derivative of $x^5$ to apply to similar-looking functions like this, but for now, we&#x2019;re stuck with only functions of the form $x^n$.
	
	Next, let&#x2019;s get the rest of the glue we need to get to polynomials &mdash; specifically, how do derivatives interact with addition, subtraction, and multiplication by constants?
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	the sum, difference, and constant multiple rules
	
	Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions and $c$ a constant number.
	
	1. (The Sum Rule) $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)$.
	
	2. (The Difference Rule) $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)$.
	
	3. (The Constant Multiple Rule) $\frac{d}{dx}[c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot f'(x)$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	These theorems tell us that derivatives split across addition and subtraction, and constant multiples factor out of derivatives. As an example, let&#x2019;s revisit the intense second derivative question from the previous section.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	the sum, difference, and constant multiple rules
	
	Find $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}[2x^2 - x]$.
	
	As before, we&#x2019;ll handle one derivative at a time.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx}[2x^2 - x] &= \frac{d}{dx}[2x^2] - \frac{d}{dx}[x]\\
			&= 2\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] - \frac{d}{dx}[x]\\
			&= 2(2x^1) - (1x^0)\\
			&= 2(2x) - (1)\\
			&= 4x - 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now we need to find the derivative of $4x - 1$.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx}[4x - 1] &= \frac{d}{dx}[4x] - \frac{d}{dx}[1]\\
			&= 4\frac{d}{dx}[x] - \frac{d}{dx}[1]\\
			&= 4(1) - 0\\
			&= 4.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	That was a whole lot easier than it was with the limit definition!

!begin-exercise

	Find $\frac{d}{dt}[t^2 - 5t + 2]$.

!text s The Product and Quotient Rules

!begin-text-block
	
	Next, let&#x2019;s talk about how to differentiate products and quotients &mdash; unlike limits, which split across both, derivatives require a little more care.

!begin-thm
	
	the product rule
	
	Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions. Then $\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$.
