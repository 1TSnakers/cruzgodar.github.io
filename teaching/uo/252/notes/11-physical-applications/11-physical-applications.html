!text b c Covered Wednesday of Week 6

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	In the final (thankfully!) section of applications of integration, we&#x2019;ll talk about a few miscellaneous topics that arean&#x2019;t large enough to get their own sections: work, mass, and tanks.
	
	Let&#x2019;s start with the simplest part: work. If you&#x2019;ve taken a physics course, you might know that work is loosely defined to be force times distance. Force is measured in Newtons ($N$), so for example, if you apply a $3\ N$ force to a cart in order to move it $9\ m$, then you do a total of $3 \cdot 9 = 27\ Nm$ of work. Like the previous problems we&#x2019;ve looked at, we&#x2019;ll be discussing problems in which the force you apply changes over time, and just like with everything else we&#x2019;ve done with integrals so far, we&#x2019;ll handle this by slicing the distance covered into tiny pieces, and integrating them.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	work done by moving an object
	
	Suppose an object is moved from $x = a$ to $x = b$, and the force done at position $x$ is $F(x)$. Then the total work done is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b F(x)\ dx.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	work done by moving an object
	
	A cart is pushed $5$ meters by applying a force of $x^2$ Newtons when the cart has been pushed $x$ meters. Find the total work done.
	
	This is just $\int_0^5 x^2\ dx = \left. \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^5 = \frac{125}{3}\ Nm$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	work done by stopping an object
	
	A cart is rolling down a hill, and you try to stop it. You apply a force of $x\ N$ <strong>against</strong> the cart when it has rolled $x\ m$, and it finally comes to a stop after $3$ meters. How much work do you do? Note that force applied against the direction of motion counts as negative.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	Moving on to other work problems, let&#x2019;s look at springs. We can do this using something called Hooke&#x2019;s law, which tells us how much force is required to stretch or compress a spring in terms of its strength.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	Every spring has an associated constant $k$, called the <dfn>spring constant</dfn>. When the spring has been stretched $x$ meters, the force to stretch it more is $kx$. Similarly, when it has been compressed $x$ meters, the force to compress it more is $kx$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	It takes $10\ Nm$ of work to compress a spring $.2\ m$ from its resting position. How much work is done if you stretch it $.5\ m$ from its resting position?
	
	The work done to compress the spring is $\int_0^{.2} kx\ dx = \frac{.2^2}{2}k = .02k$. Now this is equal to $10$, so we have that $k = 500$. Now in order to stretch the spring $.5\ m$, we have $\int_0^{.5} 500x\ dx = 500 \cdot \frac{.5^2}{2} = 62.5\ Nm$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	A spring is stretched $1\ m$, and it takes a force of $5\ N$ to stretch it more at that point. How much work is done by compressing the spring $.1\ m$ from its resting position?
	
!end-exercise



!section

!text s Mass and Density

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Just like work is force times distance, mass is density times amount. Here, amount means either length, area, or volume, depending on the shape of the object we&#x2019;re considering. As before, we&#x2019;ll look at objects with varying density &mdash; both thin bars and thin circular plates.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	mass of a bar
	
	Let $\rho(x)$ be the density of a bar at distance $x$, where $a \leq x \leq b$. Then the mass of the bar is $\int_a^b \rho(x)\ dx$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	mass of a bar
	
	Suppose a bar has density $\rho(x) = \sin(x)$ on $\left[ \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi \right]$. Find its mass.
	
	This is just
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^\pi \sin(x)\ dx &= -\cos(\pi) + \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\
			&= 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	mass of a bar
	
	Suppose a bar has density $\rho(x) = \ln(x)$ on $[1, e]$. Find its mass.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-thm
	
	mass of a disk or washer
	
	Let $\rho(r)$ be the radial density of a circular disk or washer at radius $r$ from its center, where $a \leq r \leq b$. Then the mass of the disk is $\int_a^b 2\pi r\rho(r)\ dr$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	mass of a disk
	
	Suppose a disk has radial density $\rho(r) = \sqrt{r}$ for $0 \leq r \leq 4$. Find its mass.
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^4 2\pi r \sqrt{r}\ dr &= \left. \left[ 2\pi \frac{r^{5/2}}{5/2} \right] \right|_0^4\\
			&= \frac{4\pi}{5} \left( 32 - 0 \right).
			&= \frac{128\pi}{5}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	mass of a washer
	
	Suppose a washer has radial density $\rho(r) = \frac{1}{r^2}$ for $2 \leq r \leq 4$. Find its mass.
	
!end-exercise



!section

!text s Tanks

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	The last type of problem we&#x2019;ll explore in this section has to do with the work done by pumping a substance, usually a liquid, out of a tank. This requires a bit more work: the idea is that each vertical cross-section needs to be lifted a different length out of the tank, so to find the total work done, we find the work done by lifting a single slice out (since the distance it needs to travel is the same for the whole slice), and then integrate that over all the slices. This is similar to what we&#x2019;ve done before, but the catch is that we&#x2019;re dealing with more than just solids of revolution now &mdash; the slices can be any shape.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	a cylindrical tank
	
	A cylindrical tank has radius $4$ meters. It is $10$ meters tall and is filled with water up to $8$ meters. The weight density of water is $9800\ \frac{N}{m^3}$. Find the work done by pumping out all the water over the top of the tank.
	
	<div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/cylindrical-tank.png"></img></div>
	
	Like we said before, we just need to find the work done by lifting each slice out of the tank, and then integrate that work over all the slices. Taking a cross-section at height $y$ off the ground, we have a circle with radius $4$. Its area is then $16\pi$, so the force applied to it is $9800 \cdot 16\pi$. The distance it needs to travel is $10 - y$, since it needs to go up to the top of the tank. Therefore, our integral becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^8 (9800)(16\pi)(10 - y)\ dy &= \left. \left[ (9800)(16\pi) \left(10y - \frac{y^2}{2}\right) \right] \right|_0^8\\
			&= (9800)(16\pi) \left(80 - 32\right)\\
			&= 7526400\pi.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The amount of work done is very large, but that makes sense &mdash; you&#x2019;re emptying an entire water tower&#x2019;s worth of liquid.
	
!end-example



!begin-example
	
	a pyramid
	
	A tank in the shape of a square pyramid has height $6$ and a base with side length $5$. It is completely full of a liquid with weight density $1000\ \frac{N}{m^3}$. Find the work done by pumping it all out.
	
	<div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/pyramid-tank.png"></img></div>
	
	This time, the cross-sections are squares, and their area changes as we move up the tank. To figure out how that size depends on the slice location, let&#x2019;s look at this thing from the side.
	
	<div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/pyramid-cross-section.png"></img></div>
	
	If we take a slice at height $y$, then we cut the triangle and create a smaller triangle at the bottom. Since these triangle have the same angles, they are <dfn>similar.</dfn> This means that the ratios of corresponding sides are the same: specifically, $\frac{y}{6} = \frac{b}{5}$. Therefore $b = \frac{5}{6} y$, and $b$ is the side length of the square cross-section, so its area is $b^2 = \frac{25}{36} y^2$. Now the integral takes the same form as before:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^6 (1000)\left(\frac{25}{36}y^2\right)(6 - y)\ dy &= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \int_0^6 (6y^2 - y^3)\ dy\\
			&= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \left. \left[ 2y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 \right] \right|_0^6\\
			&= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \left( 432 - 324 \right)\\
			&= 75000.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	In general, this is how all tank problems go. Take a cross-section at height $y$, find its area, possibly using similar triangles, and then integrate the expression $(\text{density})(\text{area})((\text{distance to top})$ as $y$ runs across all slices that contain liquid.
	
	This marks the end of applications of integration! In the next section, we&#x2019;ll begin to look at more techniques to find antiderivatives.
