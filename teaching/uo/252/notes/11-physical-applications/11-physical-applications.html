!begin-text-block
	
	In the final (thankfully!) section of applications of integration, we&#x2019;ll talk about a few miscellaneous topics that arean&#x2019;t large enough to get their own sections: work, mass, and tanks.
	
	Let&#x2019;s start with the simplest part: work. If you&#x2019;ve taken a physics course, you might know that work is loosely defined to be force times distance. Force is measured in Newtons ($N$), so for example, if you apply a $3\ N$ force to a cart in order to move it $9\ m$, then you do a total of $3 \cdot 9 = 27\ Nm$ of work. Like the previous problems we&#x2019;ve looked at, we&#x2019;ll be discussing problems in which the force you apply changes over time, and just like with everything else we&#x2019;ve done with integrals so far, we&#x2019;ll handle this by slicing the distance covered into tiny pieces, and integrating them.

!begin-thm
	
	work done by moving an object
	
	Suppose an object is moved from $x = a$ to $x = b$, and the force done at position $x$ is $F(x)$. Then the total work done is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b F(x)\ dx.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	work done by moving an object
	
	A cart is pushed $5$ meters by applying a force of $x^2$ Newtons when the cart has been pushed $x$ meters. Find the total work done.
	
	This is just $\int_0^5 x^2\ dx = \left. \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^5 = \frac{125}{3}\ Nm$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	work done by stopping an object
	
	A cart is rolling down a hill, and you try to stop it. You apply a force of $x\ N$ <strong>against</strong> the cart when it has rolled $x\ m$, and it finally comes to a stop after $3$ meters. How much work do you do? Note that force applied against the direction of motion counts as negative.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	Moving on to other work problems, let&#x2019;s look at springs. We can do this using something called Hooke&#x2019;s law, which tells us how much force is required to stretch or compress a spring in terms of its strength.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	Every spring has an associated constant $k$, called the <dfn>spring constant</dfn>. When the spring has been stretched $x$ meters, the force to stretch it more is $kx$. Similarly, when it has been compressed $x$ meters, the force to compress it more is $kx$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	It takes $10\ Nm$ of work to compress a spring $.2\ m$ from its resting position. How much work is done if you stretch it $.5\ m$ from its resting position?
	
	The work done to compress the spring is $\int_0^{.2} kx\ dx = \frac{.2^2}{2}k = .02k$. Now this is equal to $10$, so we have that $k = 500$. Now in order to stretch the spring $.5\ m$, we have $\int_0^{.5} 500x\ dx = 500 \cdot \frac{.5^2}{2} = 62.5\ Nm$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	Hooke&#x2019;s law
	
	A spring is stretched $1\ m$, and it takes a force of $5\ N$ to stretch it more at that point. How much work is done by compressing the spring $.1\ m$ from its resting position?
	
!end-exercise



!section

!text s Mass and Density

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Just like work is force times distance, mass is density times amount. Here, amount means either length, area, or volume, depending on the shape of the object we&#x2019;re considering. As before, we&#x2019;ll look at objects with varying density &mdash;
