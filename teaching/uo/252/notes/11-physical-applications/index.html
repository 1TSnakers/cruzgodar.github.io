If you&#x2019;ve taken a physics course, you might know that work is loosely defined to be force times distance. Force is measured in Newtons ($ N $), so for example, if you apply a $ 3\ N $ force to a cart in order to move it $ 9\ m $, then you do a total of $ 3 \cdot 9 = 27\ Nm $ of work. Like the previous problems we&#x2019;ve looked at, we&#x2019;ll be discussing problems in which the force you apply changes over time, and just like with everything else we&#x2019;ve done with integrals so far, we&#x2019;ll handle this by slicing the distance covered into tiny pieces and integrating.</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: work done by moving an object</span></p><p class="body-text">Suppose an object is moved from $ x = a $ to $ x = b $, and the force done at position $ x $ is $ F(x) $. Then the total work done is</p><p class="body-text">$$\int_a^b F(x)\,dx.$$</p></div><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: work done by moving an object</span></p><p class="body-text">A cart is pushed $ 5 $ meters by applying a force of $ x^2 $ Newtons when the cart has been pushed $ x $ meters. Find the total work done.</p><p class="body-text">We have</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^5 x^2\,dx &= \left. \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^5\\[4px]&= \frac{125}{3}\ Nm.\end{align*}$$</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: work done by stopping an object</span></p><p class="body-text">A cart is rolling down a hill, and you try to stop it. You apply a force of $ x\ N $ <strong>against</strong> the cart when it has rolled $ x\ m $, and it finally comes to a stop after $ 3 $ meters. How much work do you do? Note that force applied against the direction of motion counts as negative.</p><p class="body-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> the integral is</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^3 -x\,dx &= \left. \left[ -\frac{x^2}{2} \right] \right|_0^3\\[4px]&= -\frac{9}{2}.\end{align*}$$</p></div><p class="body-text">Moving on to other work problems, let&#x2019;s look at springs. We can do this using something called Hooke&#x2019;s law, which tells us how much force is required to stretch or compress a spring in terms of its strength.</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: Hooke's law</span></p><p class="body-text">Every spring has an associated constant $ k $, called the <strong>spring constant</strong>. When the spring has been stretched $ x $ meters, the force to stretch it more is $ kx $. Similarly, when it has been compressed $ x $ meters, the force to compress it more is $ kx $.</p></div><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: Hooke's law</span></p><p class="body-text">It takes $ 10\ Nm $ of work to compress a spring $ .2\ m $ from its resting position. How much work is done if you stretch it $ .5\ m $ from its resting position?</p><p class="body-text">The work done to compress the spring is</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^{.2} kx\,dx &= \frac{.2^2}{2}k\\[4px]&= .02k.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">Since this is equal to $ 10 $, we have that $ k = 500 $. Now in order to stretch the spring $ .5\ m $, the work done is</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^{.5} 500x\,dx &= 500 \cdot \frac{.5^2}{2}\\[4px]&= 62.5\ Nm.\end{align*}$$</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: Hooke's law</span></p><p class="body-text">A spring is stretched $ 1\ m $, and it takes a force of $ 5\ N $ to stretch it more at that point. How much work is done by compressing the spring $ .1\ m $ from its resting position?</p><p class="body-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> since the force is given by $ F(x) = kx $ and $ F(1) = 5 $, we have that $ k = 5 $. We now want to find the work, which is</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^{.1} 5x\,dx &= \left. \left[ \frac{5x^2}{2} \right] \right|_0^{.1}\\[4px]&= .025\ Nm.\end{align*}$$</p></div></section><h2 class="section-text"> Mass and Density</h2><section><p class="body-text">Just like work is force times distance, mass is density times amount. Here, amount means either length, area, or volume, depending on the shape of the object we&#x2019;re considering. As before, we&#x2019;ll look at objects with varying density &mdash; both thin bars and thin circular plates.</p><div class="notes-thm notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-thm-title">Theorem: mass of a bar</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $ \rho(x) $ be the density of a bar at distance $ x $, where $ a \leq x \leq b $.

This requires a bit more work: the idea is that each vertical cross-section needs to be lifted a different height out of the tank, so in order to find the total work done, we find the work done by lifting a single slice out. Since the distance traveled is the same for the whole slice, that work will be a function of the height of the slice only, which we&#x2019;ll typically denote $ y $. We can then integrate that work over the $ y $-values of all of the slices. This is similar to the disk method for solids of revolution given by rotating a function about the $ y $-axis, but the big difference is that these slices can be any shape.</p><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: a cylindrical tank</span></p><p class="body-text">A tank in the shape of a cylinder has radius $ 4 $ meters. It&#x2019;s $ 10 $ meters tall and is filled with water up to $ 8 $ meters, and the weight density of water is $ 9800\,\frac{N}{m^3} $. Find the work done by pumping out all the water out over the top of the tank.</p><div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/cylindrical-tank.png"></img></div><p class="body-text">Like we said before, we just need to find the work done by lifting each slice out of the tank, and then integrate that work over all the slices. Taking a cross-section at height $ y $ off the ground, we have a circle with radius $ 4 $. Its area is then $ 16\pi $, so the force applied to it is $ 9800 \cdot 16\pi $. The distance it needs to travel is $ 10 - y $, since it needs to go up to the top of the tank. Therefore, our integral becomes</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^8 (9800)(16\pi)(10 - y)\,dy &= \left. \left[ (9800)(16\pi) \left(10y - \frac{y^2}{2}\right) \right] \right|_0^8\\[4px]&= (9800)(16\pi) \left(80 - 32\right)\\[4px]&= 7526400\pi.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">The amount of work done is pretty massive, but that makes sense &mdash; you&#x2019;re emptying an entire water tower&#x2019;s worth of liquid.</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: a pyramid</span></p><p class="body-text">A tank in the shape of a square pyramid has height $ 6 $ and a base with side length $ 5 $, and it&#x2019;s completely full of a liquid with weight density $ 1000\,\frac{N}{m^3} $. Find the work done by pumping it all out.</p><div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/pyramid-tank.png"></img></div><p class="body-text"><strong>Solution</strong>: this time, the cross-sections are squares, and their area changes as we move up the tank. To figure out how that size depends on the slice location, let&#x2019;s look at this thing from the side.</p><div class="center-content"><img class="notes-image" src="/teaching/uo/252/notes/11-physical-applications/graphics/pyramid-cross-section.png"></img></div><p class="body-text">If we take a slice at height $ y $, then we cut the triangle and create a smaller triangle at the bottom. Since these two triangles have the same angles, they&#x2019;re <strong>similar.</strong> That means the ratios of corresponding sides are the same: specifically, $ \frac{y}{6} = \frac{b}{5} $. Therefore, $ b = \frac{5}{6} y $, and $ b $ is the side length of the square cross-section, so the area is $ b^2 = \frac{25}{36} y^2 $. Now the integral takes the same form as before:</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\int_0^6 (1000)\left(\frac{25}{36}y^2\right)(6 - y)\,dy &= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \int_0^6 (6y^2 - y^3)\,dy\\[4px]&= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \left. \left[ 2y^3 - \frac{1}{4}y^4 \right] \right|_0^6\\[4px]&= (1000) \left(\frac{25}{36}\right) \left( 432 - 324 \right)\\[4px]&= 75000.\end{align*}$$</p></div><p class="body-text">In general, this is how tank problems go. Take a cross-section at height $ y $, find its area, possibly using similar triangles, and then evaluate the integral</p><p class="body-text">$$\int_a^b (\text{density})(\text{area})(\text{distance})\,dy$$</p><p class="body-text">where the interval $ [a, b] $ contains all the $ y $-values of slices that contain liquid.</p><p class="body-text">This marks the end of applications of integration! In the next section, we&#x2019;ll begin to look at more techniques to find antiderivatives.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script src="/scripts/init.min.js"></script></body></html>
