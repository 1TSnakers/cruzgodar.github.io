	It&#x2019;s the final section! We&#x2019;ll depart from the previous topics to examine a common application of integration: differential equations. This is a deep enough topic that whole courses are dedicated to it, but we&#x2019;ll just be taking a brief overview, split into three parts: what are differential equations, how do we visualize them, and how can we solve them?
