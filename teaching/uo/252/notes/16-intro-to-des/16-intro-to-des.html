!header Section 16: Intro to Differential Equations

!text b c Covered Wednesday of Week 9

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	It&#x2019;s the final section! We&#x2019;ll depart from the previous topics to examine a common application of integration: differential equations. This is a deep enough topic that whole courses are dedicated to it, but we&#x2019;ll just be taking a brief overview, split into three parts: what are differential equations, how do we visualize them, and how can we solve them?
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	differential equation
	
	A <dfn>differential equation</dfn>, or a <dfn>DE</dfn>, is an equation involving a function $y = f(x)$ and its derivatives. They&#x2019;re like polynomials, but instead of increasing the power on $x$, we increase the order of derivatives.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	some differential equations
	
	$y' = y + 2x$.
	
	$y''' + y' - y = 3$.
	
!end-example



!begin-def
	
	solution to a DE
	
	A solution to a DE is a function $y = f(x)$ satisfying the equation.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	solution to a DE
	
	A solution to $y' + 3y = 6x + 11$ is $y = e^{-3x} + 2x + 3$, since $y' = -3e^{-3x} + 2$, and so we get
	
	$$
		y' + 3y = -3e^{-3x} + 2 + 3e^{-3x} + 6x + 9 = 6x + 11.
	$$	
	
!end-example



!section

!text s Direction Fields

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	A direction field lets us visualize how a DE acts over time. To draw one, we solve for $y'$, then draw a line segment at every point $(x, y)$ that has the slope given by $y'$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	direction field
	
	Below is the direction field for the differential equation $y' - \frac{1}{30}xy = 0$.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/5rnbmsymfx" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	direction field
	
	Draw a direction field for $y' = \frac{1}{20}(x^2 - 1)\sin(y)$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	By definition, a solution to the DE is a function whose slope matches the direction field, so the graph of a solution follows the direction field like guidelines.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	direction field
	
	One solution to $y' - xy = 0$ is $y = e^{x^2 / 60}$.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nwunmcch4d" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
	As we can see, this function follows the direction field. Another solution that follows the field is $y = 0$, and this is a special type of solution:
	
!end-example



!begin-def
	
	equilibrium solution
	
	An <dfn>equilibrium solution</dfn> to a DE is a solution $y = c$ for some number $c$. In a direction field, this appears as a horizontal line.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	equilibrium solution
	
	Find all equilibrium solutions to $y' = \frac{1}{20}(x-3)(y^2 - 4)$.
	
	If $y = c$, then $y' = 0$, so to find the equilibrium solutions, we just need to set $(x-3)(y^2 - 4) = 0$. Then $x = 3$, $y = -2$, or $y = 2$, and we only want the solutions of the form $y = c$, so we want $y = \pm 2$.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/5ssixh7zd5" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	Two special types of equilibrium solutions are those that either attract or repel their neighbors.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	stable and unstable equilibrium solutions
	
	An equilibrium solution $y = c$ is <dfn>stable</dfn> if for large $x$, the direction field around $y = c$ points toward it. It is <dfn>unstable</dfn> if for large $x$, the direction field around $y = c$ points away. If some points toward it and some points away, then the solution is neither stable nor unstable.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	stable and unstable equilibrium solutions
	
	In the previous example, $y = 2$ is an unstable solution, since the direction field eventually points away from it for large $x$. Similarly, $y = -2$ is a stable solution. In general, to know how large to draw the direction field to determine if a solution is stable or unstable, make it large enough to capture all the places where the $y' = 0$, including $x$-values. In the previous example, that&#x2019;s $x = 3$.
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	A nice way to think about stable solutions is by imagining a small ball placed into a hemispherical dish. It settles to the bottom, and nudging it slightly in any direction will just result it in settling back down to where it was. On the other hand, unstable solutions are akin to turning the bowl upside-down and balancing the ball on the top of it. There is a single point where the ball will balance, but nudging it slightly in any direction makes the ball roll away from the center.

!text s Separable DEs

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Okay, so how to we solve DEs? This is the subject that all those future classes are devoted to, but we&#x2019;ll just look at the simplest possible type: something called a separable DE.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	separable DE
	
	A differentiable equation is <dfn>separable</dfn> if it can be written in the form $y' = f(x)g(y)$ for some functions $f$ and $g$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	In other words, a separable equation is one where we can get $y'$ by itself and write the other side as ($x$-stuff)($y$-stuff). If this is the case, we&#x2019;ll go through the following process, called <dfn>separation of variables</dfn>:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	separation of variables
	
	To solve a DE of the form $y' = f(x)g(y)$:
	
	1. Rewrite $y'$ as $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to get $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$.
	
	2. Divide both sides by $g(y)$ and multiply both sides by $dx$ to get $\frac{1}{g(y)}\ dy = f(x)\ dx$.
	
	3. Add an integral to both sides: $\int \frac{1}{g(y)}\ dy = \int f(x)\ dx$.
	
	4. Integrate.
	
	5. Solve for $y$. There will still be the integration constant $C$ in your answer
