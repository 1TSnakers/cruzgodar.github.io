	Fundamentally, definite integrals calculate area under curves. If you stick around to Calc IV, you&#x2019;ll learn how to extend integrals to calculate volume under surfaces too, which turns out to be the natural way to extend integrals to three dimensions. But right now, we can use the kind of integrals we&#x2019;ve developed so far to calculate certain volumes, ones called <dfn>solids of revolution</dfn>
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	solid of revolution
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function on $[a, b]$ with $f(x) \geq 0$. A <dfn>solid of revolution</dfn> is the solid $3$-dimensional shape created by rotating the graph of $f$ on $[a, b]$ about the $x$-axis or $y$-axis.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	solid of revolution
	
	With $f(x) = \sin(x) + 2$ on $[0, 10]$, the solid of revolution of $f$ about the $x$-axis is plotted below.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/txwzemcsmi" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
	Desmos is obviously not a 3d graphing engine, but it still does a great job of plotting these things. Even if you don&#x2019;t normally, <strong>please take the time to poke around with this one</strong> &mdash; there&#x2019;s a lot to digest. First of all, note that the solid is shown properly when $n = 1$ &mdash; other values of $n$ are to demonstrate the process of revolution. Change $f$ and/or $g$, along with $a$ and $b$, and see what happens.
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	Our goal is to find the volume of these things. We&#x2019;ll have two ways to do this &mdash; like we alluded to before, one will end up with an integral $dx$, and the other with an integral $dy$. Let&#x2019;s start with the simplest one first, which is called the <dfn>disk method</dfn>.
	
	When we rotate a graph about the $x$-axis, cross sections of the solid taken perpendicular to the $x$-axis are always circles. The example below highlights those cross sections in red &mdash; slide $x_0$ to change which cross section is shown.

	Now a definite integral just adds up whatever is inside of it over an interval, creating an area. If we instead add up the areas of all those circles, we&#x2019;ll get the volume of that region. And what is that red area? Well, it&#x2019;s a circle, so we just need its radius. But you can see from the picture that the radius is given by the height of the funciton, which is $f(x)$. Therefore, the area is $\pi r^2 = \pi (f(x))^2$. This leads us to the following result:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm
	
	the disk method
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a positive function on $[a, b]$. The volume of the solid created by revolving $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b \pi (f(x))^2\ dx.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	the disk method
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving $f(x) = \frac{3}{x}$ on $[1, 5]$ about the $x$-axis.
	
	This solid is plotted in the previous graph. Applying the disk method, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_1^5 \pi \left( \frac{3}{x} \right)^2\ dx &= \int_1^5 \frac{9\pi}{x^2}\ dx\\
			&= \left. \left[ -\frac{9\pi}{x} \right] \right|_1^5\\
			&= -\frac{9\pi}{5} + 9\pi.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	the disk method
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving $f(x) = \sin(x) + 2$ on $[0, \pi]$ about the $x$-axis.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	That wasn&#x2019;t so bad! We can also use the same method for functions revolved about the $y$-axis, but we&#x2019;ll need to solve them to be defined in terms of $y$ first.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	the disk method, again
	
	The area bounded by $y = x^3$ and $x = 0$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find the volume between $y = 0$ and $y = 2$.
	
	First, we need to rewrite this as a function of $y$: $x = y^{1/3}$. Then we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^2 \pi \left( y^{1/3} \right)^2\ dy &= \int_0^2 \pi y^{2/3}\ dy\\
			&= \left. \left[ \pi \frac{y^{5/3}}{5/3} \right] \right|_0^2\\
			&= \pi \frac{2^{5/3}}{5/3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b6tavehd10" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	the disk method, again
	
	The area bounded by $y = \frac{1}{x}$, and $x = 0$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find the volume between $y = 1$ and $y = 2$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	The disk method can be extended to work with problems where we&#x2019;re taking the difference between two functions and rotating that. Some books, including ours, call this the <strong>washer method</strong>, but we won&#x2019;t use that term often for two reasons: it&#x2019;s identical to the disk method, and more importantly, we&#x2019;ll see a method later in this section that is genuinely different and <em>looks</em> like washers, to the point where it&#x2019;s very common for students to get the two confused.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	the disk method with a hole
	
	The area bounded by $y = x$ and $y = \sqrt{x}$ is revolved about the $x$-axis. Find its volume.
	
	Let&#x2019;s visualize what&#x2019;s going on here. Just like in the previous section, we set the two functions equal to get $x = 0$ or $x = 1$, and drawing a 2D plot, we can see the area that&#x2019;s going to be rotated.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/u1dhi35rfb" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
	So what does this look like when it&#x2019;s revolved about the $x$-axis? Well, both the inner function and outer function produce circles, so cross sections look like large circles with smaller circles cut out of them.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fztvietv2h" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
	In order to find the area of one of these things, we need just need to take the area of the larger circle and subtract the area of the hole. Since the outer area is $\pi (\sqrt{x})^2$ and the inner one is $\pi x^2$, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^1 \left( \pi (\sqrt{x})^2 - \pi x^2 \right)\ dx &= \int_0^1 \left( \pi x - \pi x^2 \right)\ dx\\
			&= \left. \left[ \pi \frac{x^2}{2} - \pi \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^1\\
			&= \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{3}\\
			&= \frac{\pi}{6}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
