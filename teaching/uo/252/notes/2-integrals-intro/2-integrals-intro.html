!header Intro to Integrals



!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s get right to it. We have Riemann sums, which approximate the area under the graph of nonnegative functions (i.e. ones that stay on or above the $x$-axis). We can choose the points $x_i^*$ within the subintervals however we like, but for well-behaved functions, it won&#x2019;t end up mattering. As the number of subintervals limits to infinity, the total area of the rectangles approaches the actual area under the curve.

!begin-def
	
	definite integral
	
	Let $f$ be a nonnegative function defined on $[a, b]$. The <dfn>definite integral</dfn> of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is the area under the graph of $f$ on $[a, b]$, written $\int_a^b f(x)\ dx$ and defined by
	
	$$\int_a^b f(x)\ dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n f(x_i^*) \Delta x,$$
	
	provided the limit exists. If it does, we say that $f$ is <dfn>integrable</dfn> on $[a, b]$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	The notation looks a little strange at first, but it&#x2019;s designed to match a Riemann sum. The $dx$ takes the place of the $\Delta x$ from the sum, and it carries the same meaning as the $dx$ in $\frac{dy}{dx}$ &mdash; it&#x2019;s an infinitesimal change in $x$, indicating that the rectangles have become &#x201C;infinitely thin&#x201D;.
	
	Being integrable is a complicated condition &mdash; it&#x2019;s not immediately clear what makes the limit of Riemann sums exist. For now, we can say at least one thing:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	continuous functions are integrable
	
	Let $f$ be a function that is nonnegative and continuous on $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$.

!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	At this point, we&#x2019;re in desperate need of examples. Let&#x2019;s start with something we can do without even needing to worry about limits.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example

	computing an integral geometrically
	
	Find $\int_{-1}^3 |x|\ dx$.
	
	It&#x2019;s always a good idea to draw a picture of what&#x2019;s going on before digging into the equations.

	The integral we&#x2019;re trying to calculate is, by definition, the area of the shaded region. That region consists of two triangles &mdash; the left one has base and height $1$, while the right one has base and height $3$. The total area is therefore $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 5$. In total, $\int_{-1}^3 |x|\ dx = 5$.

!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	computing an integral geometrically
	
	Find $\int_1^3 2x \ dx$ geometrically.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-example

	computing an integral from the limit definition
	
	Find $\int_0^2 t^2\ dt$.
	
	Of course, the whole point of integrals is that it&#x2019;s not always as easy as the previous example. That was like computing the derivative of a straight line &mdash; we don&#x2019;t need the heavy machinery of derivatives to find its slope. Similarly, we don&#x2019;t need integrals to find the area of a triangle, although it&#x2019;s good practice. This function is a parabola, though, and we don&#x2019;t know a simple formula for the shaded area. There&#x2019;s no getting around it &mdash; we need to use the definition of the integral.
	
	We need to start with a Riemann sum. Since $f(t) = t^2$ is a continuous function, it&#x2019;s integrable, so it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we choose a left sum, a right one, an upper one, a lower one, or any other type. Let&#x2019;s choose a right sum for simplicity. Critically, since we&#x2019;re eventually going to limit the number of subintervals to infinity, we need to leave it as a variable. If we have $n$ subintervals, then we&#x2019;re dividing the interval $[0, 2]$ into $n$ equal-sized pieces, so each one has width $\frac{2}{n}$.
	
	<div class="center-content"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jjbbtaysvv" width="500" height="500"></iframe></div>
	
	Now in the $i$th subinterval, the right endpoint has $x$-coordinate $\frac{2}{n} i$ (take a moment to make sure that makes sense). We&#x2019;re trying to find the value of the Riemann sum, so we need to add up the area of all $n$ rectangles. The height of the $i$th one is
	
	$$f\left( \frac{2}{n} i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{n} i \right)^2 = \frac{4}{n^2} i^2,$$
	
	so in total, our Riemann sum becomes
	
	$$\sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{4}{n^2} i^2 \right) \left( \frac{2}{n} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{8}{n^3} i^2.$$
	
	This is looking pretty rough, but remember &mdash; that $\frac{8}{n^3}$ is a constant for now, since we haven&#x2019;t taken a limit yet. That means we can pull it out of the sum, and then we know how to handle what&#x2019;s left.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{8}{n^3} i^2 &= \frac{8}{n^3} \sum_{i = 1}^n i^2\\
			&= \frac{8}{n^3} \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\\
			&= \frac{8(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)}{6n^3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Almost there! The integral we&#x2019;re trying to find is the limit of this as $n \to \infty$. It&#x2019;s a rational function, so we can consider only the highest-degree terms: $16n^3$ on top and $6n^3$ on bottom. Therefore,
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^2 t^2\ dt &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{8(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)}{6n^3}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{16n^3}{6n^3}\\
			&= \frac{8}{3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	We did it! And along the way we learned that we <strong>really</strong> need a better way to do this. Unlike derivatives, though, the rules for integration won&#x2019;t come easily.
