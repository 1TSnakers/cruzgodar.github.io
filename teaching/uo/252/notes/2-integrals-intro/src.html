!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s get right to it! We have Riemann sums, which approximate the area under the graph of nonnegative functions, and we can choose the points $x_i^*$ within the subintervals however we like (left, right, upper and lower sums are all examples of that choice). For well-behaved functions, it won&#x2019;t end up mattering, though. As the number of subintervals limits to infinity, the total area of the rectangles will approach the actual area under the curve.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	definite integral
	
	Let $f$ be a nonnegative function defined on $[a, b]$. The <dfn>definite integral</dfn> of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is the area under the graph of $f$ on $[a, b]$, written as $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ and defined by
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n f(x_i^*) \Delta x,
	$$
	
	where the sum is a Riemann sum with $n$ rectangles. If the limit exists, we say that $f$ is <dfn>integrable</dfn> on $[a, b]$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	The notation looks a little strange at first, but it&#x2019;s designed to match a Riemann sum. The $dx$ takes the place of the $\Delta x$, and it carries the same meaning as the $dx$ in $\frac{dy}{dx}$ &mdash; it&#x2019;s an infinitesimal change in $x$, indicating that the rectangles have become infinitely thin.
	
	Being integrable is a complicated condition &mdash; it&#x2019;s not clear what properties a function could have that would make the limit of Riemann sums exist. For now, we can say at least one thing:
	
!end-text-block



!begin-thm

	continuous functions are integrable
	
	Let $f$ be a function that is nonnegative and continuous on $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$.

!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	At this point, we&#x2019;re in desperate need of examples. Let&#x2019;s start with something we can do without even needing to worry about limits.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example

	computing an integral geometrically
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_{-1}^3 |x|\,dx$.
	
	Especially with integrals, it&#x2019;s always a good idea to draw a picture of what&#x2019;s going on before digging into the equations.
	
	!desmos geometric-integral
	
	The integral we&#x2019;re trying to calculate is by definition the area of the shaded region. That region consists of two triangles &mdash; the left one has base and height $1$, while the right one has base and height $3$. The total area is therefore
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 5.
	$$
	
	In total, $\int_{-1}^3 |x|\,dx = 5$.

!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	computing an integral geometrically
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_1^3 2x \,dx$ geometrically.
	
	<strong>Solution:</strong> the area in question looks like the following:
	
	!desmos geometric-integral-2
	
	This can be split into a square with side length $2$ and a triangle with base $2$ and height $4$. In total, the area is therefore $4 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 8$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-example

	computing an integral from the limit definition
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_0^2 t^2\,dt$.
	
	It&#x2019;s not always as easy as the previous example. That was a lot like computing the derivative of a straight line &mdash; we don&#x2019;t need the heavy machinery of derivatives to find its slope. Similarly, we don&#x2019;t need integrals to find the area of a triangle, although it&#x2019;s a good example to get our bearings. This time around, what we have is a parabola, and we don&#x2019;t know a simple formula for the shaded area. There&#x2019;s no getting around it &mdash; we need to use the definition of the integral.
	
	We need to start with a Riemann sum. Since $f(t) = t^2$ is a continuous function, it&#x2019;s integrable, so it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we choose a left sum, a right one, an upper one, a lower one, or any other type. In general, right Riemann sums have the simplest formulas, so let&#x2019;s choose to use one of them. Since we&#x2019;re eventually going to limit the number of subintervals to infinity, we need to leave that number (i.e. $n$) as a variable. If we have $n$ subintervals, then we&#x2019;re dividing the interval $[0, 2]$ into $n$ equal-sized pieces, so each one has width $\frac{2}{n}$.
	
	!desmos integral-from-limit-def
	
	In the $i$th subinterval, the right endpoint has $x$-coordinate $\frac{2}{n} i$. That&#x2019;s because the right endpoint of the first interval is $\frac{2}{n}$, the right endpoint of the second is $\frac{2}{n}(2)$, and so on. We&#x2019;re trying to find the value of the Riemann sum, so we need to add up the area of all $n$ rectangles. The height of the $i$th one is
	
	$$
		f\left( \frac{2}{n} i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{n} i \right)^2 = \frac{4}{n^2} i^2,
	$$
	
	so in total, our Riemann sum becomes
	
	$$
		\sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{4}{n^2} i^2 \right) \left( \frac{2}{n} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{8}{n^3} i^2.
	$$
	
	This is looking pretty rough, but remember &mdash; that $\frac{8}{n^3}$ is a constant as far as the sum is concerned. That means we can pull it out, and then we know how to handle what&#x2019;s left.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{8}{n^3} i^2 &= \frac{8}{n^3} \sum_{i = 1}^n i^2\\
			&= \frac{8}{n^3} \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\\
			&= \frac{8(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)}{6n^3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Almost there! The integral we&#x2019;re trying to find is the limit of this as $n \to \infty$. It&#x2019;s a rational function, so we can consider only the highest-degree terms: $16n^3$ on top and $6n^3$ on bottom. Therefore,
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^2 t^2\,dt &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{8(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)}{6n^3}\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{16n^3}{6n^3}\\
			&= \frac{8}{3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	We did it! And along the way we learned that we <strong>really</strong> need a better way to do this. Unlike derivatives, though, the rules for integration won&#x2019;t come easily.

!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	computing an integral from the limit definition
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_0^3 t^3\,dt$ from the limit definition.
	
	<strong>Solution:</strong> split $[0, 3]$ into $n$ subintervals. The width of each is therefore $\frac{3}{n}$, and the coordinate of the right endpoint of the $i$th subinterval is $\frac{3}{n}i$. Therefore, the Riemann sum becomes 
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i = 1}^n f \left( \frac{3}{n} i \right) \left( \frac{3}{n} \right) &= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{27}{n^3} i^3 \right) \left( \frac{3}{n} \right)\\
			&= \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{81}{n^4} i^3\\
			&= \frac{81}{n^4} \sum_{i = 1}^n i^3\\
			&= \frac{81}{n^4} \cdot \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}\\
			&= \frac{81n^4 + 162n^3 + 81n^2}{4n^4}.\\
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Now taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ by only considering the leading terms, we get $\frac{81n^4}{4n^4} = \frac{81}{4}$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s look at one more type of integral that we can handle geometrically, and then we&#x2019;ll write down a few properties of integrals.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	another geometric integral
	
	Compute $\displaystyle \int_3^6 \sqrt{9 - (x - 3)^2}\,dx$.
	
	As always, it&#x2019;s good to draw a picture. Our function is $y = \sqrt{9 - (x - 3)^2}$, so $(x-3)^2 + y^2 = 3^2$. This is a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(3, 0)$, and since $\sqrt{9 - (x - 3)^2}$ is always positive, so the graph is only the top half of the circle.
	
	!desmos geometric-integral-3
	
	The shaded area is just a quarter of the area of a full circle with radius $3$, so in total, it&#x2019;s $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 9\pi$.
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	So far, we&#x2019;ve only defined integrals for functions that are nonnegative. We&#x2019;ll need to integrate functions other than these too, but the definition of area under a curve needs a slight adjustment.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	signed area
	
	Let $f$ be an integrable function on $[a, b]$. The integral $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ is the area under the graph of $f$, where area below the $x$-axis is counted as negative.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	signed area
	
	$\int_{-2}^2 x^3\,dx = 0$, since the areas above (red) and below (blue) the $x$-axis are equal.
	
	!desmos signed-area
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	Since they&#x2019;re defined as limits of sums, integrals have many of the same nice properties.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	basic integral properties
	
	1. $\displaystyle \int_a^a f(x)\,dx = 0$ (lines have no area).
	
	2. $\displaystyle \int_a^b (f(x) + g(x))\,dx = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \int_a^b g(x)\,dx$.
	
	3. $\displaystyle \int_a^b c \cdot f(x)\,dx = c\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$.
	
	4. For $\displaystyle a \leq c \leq b$, $\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx + \int_c^b f(x)\,dx$.
	
	5. If $\displaystyle f(x) \geq g(x)$ on $\displaystyle [a, b]$, then $\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \geq \int_a^b g(x)\,dx$.
	
	Property 4 is the same kind of stitching-together property as the one for sums &mdash; we&#x2019;re just breaking an area into two pieces. This is particularly useful for piecewise-defined functions, since we can integrate each piece separately and add up the results.
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	One quantity integrals let us calculate conveniently is average value &mdash; for a list of values, we add them all up and divide by the number of values, but for a function, we&#x2019;ll need to be a little more careful.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	average value
	
	Let $f$ be a function on $[a, b]$. The <dfn>average value</dfn> of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{b - a} \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	This is a reasonable definition, since the integral is adding up the values of $f(x)$ over $[a, b]$, and $\frac{1}{b - a}$ is, in a sense, the amount of values added up.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	average value
	
	The average value of $f(x) = x^2$ on $[0, 2]$ is $\frac{1}{2 - 0} \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{8}{6}$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	average value
	
	Find the average value of $g(x) = x^3$ on $[0, 3]$.
	
	<strong>Solution:</strong> Using the previous value of $\frac{81}{4}$, we get $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{81}{4} = \frac{27}{4}$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	In the next section, we&#x2019;ll take a break from computing areas to work on some machinery that will let us bypass the limit definition of the integral.
