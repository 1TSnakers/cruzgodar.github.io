There are quite a few places we could go next, but the one we&#x2019;ll be spending this class on is something we&#x2019;re very well-prepared for: integration. Our ultimate goal in the class will be to calculate the <strong>area under curves</strong>: areas which are bounded by functions.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="test-graph" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">It&#x2019;s totally not clear how we&#x2019;re going to do this! But just like with derivatives, we&#x2019;ll start by approximating the area, and then taking the limit of better and better approximations. With derivatives, approximations meant secant lines, but here, it&#x2019;ll take a bit more work.</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Sums</h2><section><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: sigma notation</span></p><p class="body-text">We write $\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i$ to mean $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n$, and we read it as &#x201C;the sum from $i = 1$ to $n$ of $a_i$&#x201D;.

Both answers are correct!</p></div><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s write down a few basic properties of sums.

Without this formula, we&#x2019;d be stuck adding up 1 through 100 by hand.</p><p class="body-text">2. There is a slightly more complicated situation, but we can still take advantage of these formulas. Intuition says that we should try to use the one for the sum of squares, but that only works when we start at $1$ and go up from there. To figure out how to use it, we first need to write the sum in sigma notation.</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}-50^2 - 49^2 - 48^2 - \cdots - 20^2 = \sum_{i = 20}^{50} -i^2.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">Since the sum of squares formula doesn&#x2019;t have a minus sign inside the sum, let&#x2019;s factor it out.</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}\sum_{i = 20}^{50} -i^2 = -\sum_{i = 20}^{50} i^2.\end{align*}$$</p><p class="body-text">Now the trickiest step: we have a sum that starts at $20$, but we only have a formula for a sum that starts at $1$.

Let&#x2019;s return to our original goal of approximating the area under a curve &mdash; we&#x2019;re going to do that with a lot of rectangles.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-def-title">Definition: Riemann sum</span></p><p class="body-text">Let $f$ be a <strong>nonnegative</strong> function defined on the interval $[a, b]$ and let $\{x_0, x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a regular partition of $[a, b]$, where the distance between the $x_i$ is $\Delta x$.

We&#x2019;ll spend the rest of this section getting a grip on exactly what&#x2019;s going on.</p><p class="body-text">First of all, Riemann sums are areas. Every one of the $n$ terms in a sum is the area of a rectangle with width $\Delta x$ and height $f(x_i^*)$.

Change $a$ and $b$ and $n$, and change $f$ to another positive function like $x^2$. The two large sum expressions are calculating the left and right Riemann sums, respectively &mdash; notice how they both get close to $10$ as $n$ gets larger. </p><div class="notes-ex notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-ex-title">Example: Riemann sum</span></p><p class="body-text">Compute the upper Riemann sum with $5$ intervals for the function $g(t) = t^2$ on the interval $[-5, 5]$.</p><p class="body-text">If we want to split $[-5, 5]$ into five equal subintervals, we need the partition $\{-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5\}$. Now we&#x2019;re doing an upper sum, so for each of the five subintervals, we need to find the $t$-value that maximizes the function. Working this through, we find that the points are $-5, -3, -1, 3, 5$. The $-1$ could also be taken to be $t = 1$, since they both have $g(t) = 1$.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="riemann-sum-2" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">The base of every rectangle is $\Delta t = 2$, so in total, the sum is</p><p class="body-text">$$\begin{align*}g(-5) \cdot 2 + g(-3) \cdot 2 + g(-1) \cdot 2 + g(3) \cdot 2 + g(5) \cdot 2 &= 50 + 18 + 2 + 18 + 50\\[4px]&= 138.\end{align*}$$</p></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><p class="body-text"</p><span class="notes-exc-title">Exercise: Riemann sum</span></p><p class="body-text">Compute the left Riemann sum with $5$ intervals for the function $g(t) = t^4$ on the interval $[-5, 5]$.

Well, just like we defined the derivative to be the slope of a tangent line, but we actually computed it by taking the limit of slopes of secant lines, we&#x2019;re going to define another object that gives the area under a curve, and then we&#x2019;ll compute it by taking the limit of Riemann sums as the number of subintervals approaches infinity. Also like derivatives, the limit definition is going to be a major pain to actually use, so we&#x2019;ll spend much of the course building formulas and rules that let us compute that area without going to so much trouble. In the next section, we&#x2019;ll get the limit definition working and use it to compute some areas.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script src="/scripts/init.min.js"></script></body></html>
