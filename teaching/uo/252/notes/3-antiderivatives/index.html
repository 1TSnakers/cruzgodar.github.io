!begin-text-block
	
	We need to take a brief deviation from definite integrals to work on something different. It&#x2019;ll seem completely unrelated at first, but in the next section, we&#x2019;ll connect it back to our main goal.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	antiderivative
	
	Let $f$ be a function. A function $F$ is an <dfn>antiderivative</dfn> of $f$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	antiderivatives
	
	$F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}$ is an antiderivative of $f(x) = x^2$, since $\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] = x^2$. The function $G(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + 2$ is also an antiderivative, since the $2$ differentiates to zero. Similarly, for any constant $C$, $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$ is an antiderivative of $x^2$.
	
	!desmos antiderivative
	
	In fact, <strong>all</strong> antiderivatives of $x^2$ are of the form $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$.
	
!end-example



!begin-thm
	
	classification of antiderivatives
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function with an antiderivative $F(x)$. Then all antiderivatives of $f$ are of the form $F(x) + C$.
	
!end-thm



!begin-text-block
	
	It&#x2019;d be nice to have some notation to represent the operation of taking an antiderivative &mdash; something like $\frac{d}{dx}$, but in reverse. As strange as it might seem right now, we&#x2019;re actually going to use the integral symbol for this. It may be confusing right now, but in the next section, we&#x2019;ll see why it&#x2019;s the best possible notation we could choose.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	indefinite integral
	
	Let $f$ be a function. The <dfn>indefinite integral</dfn> of $f$ is
	
	$$
		\int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C,
	$$
	
	where $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	So the only notational difference between the definite integral that measures area under a graph and the indefinite integral that takes an antiderivative is that definite integrals are written with the two numbers on the integral sign (called <dfn>limits of integration</dfn>), and indefinite integrals are bare. In other words, $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ measures area under the graph of $f$ between $x = a$ and $x = b$, and $\int f(x)\,dx$ is an antiderivative of $f$. Let&#x2019;s focus on indefinite integrals for the moment.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	indefinite integrals
	
	$\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{t}\,dt = \ln |t| + C$.
	
	$\displaystyle \int \sin(x)\,dx = -\cos(x) + C$.
	
	$\displaystyle \int e^u\,du = e^u + C$.
	
	$\displaystyle \int x^p\,dx = \frac{x^{p + 1}}{p + 1} + C$ if $p \neq -1$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	indefinite integrals
	
	Find the following:
	
	$\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{t^2}\,dt$.
	
	$\displaystyle \int \sec^2(y)\,dy$.
	
	$\displaystyle \int (mx + b)\,dx$.
	
	<strong>Solutions:</strong>
	
	1. $-\frac{1}{t} + C$.
	
	2. $\tan(y) + C$.
	
	3. $\frac{m}{2}x^2 + bx + C$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	Because derivatives factor through both addition and multiplication by a constant, so do antiderivatives.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	properties of indefinite integrals
	
	1. $\displaystyle \int (f(x) + g(x))\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx + \int g(x)\,dx$.
	
	2. $\displaystyle \int c \cdot f(x)\,dx = c\int f(x)\,dx$.
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	One immediate use of indefinite integrals is to solve <dfn>initial value problems</dfn> &mdash; problems of the form
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			y'(x) &= f(x)\\
			y(x_0) &= y_0
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The idea is that we can solve for $y$ by integrating $f(x)$, but that will leave the constant $C$ in our solution. But then we can solve for $C$ with the second equation (called the <dfn>initial value</dfn>).
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	an initial value problem
	
	A snail is trying its best to get up to cruising speed. After $t$ seconds, its velocity in millimeters per second is given by $v(t) = 3t + 2$, and one second after taking off, it&#x2019;s moved $2$ millimeters. Find a function $s(t)$ that gives its distance in millimeters traveled after $t$ seconds.
	
	Since $v'(t) = s(t)$, we have that
	
	$$
		s(t) = \int v(t)\,dt = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t + C.
	$$
	
	Now since $s(1) = 2$, we can solve for $C$: $\frac{3}{2} + 2 + C = 2$, so $C = -\frac{3}{2}$. In total,
	
	$$
		s(t) = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t - \frac{3}{2}.
	$$
	
!end-example



!begin-exercise
	
	an initial value problem
	
	For as long as you can remember, your life&#x2019;s purpose has been to throw a baseball at escape velocity. Today, you decide to throw it vertically upward, and the fastest you can throw is $4 \frac{m}{s}$. The ball leaves your hand $1$ meter off the ground, and acceleration due to gravity is (sadly) always $a(t) = -9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$. Find a function $h(t)$ that gives the height of the ball above the ground in meters $t$ seconds after leaving your hand.
	
	<strong>Solution:</strong> We have $h(0) = 1$ and $v(0) = 4$. Now $v(t) = \int a(t)\,dt = -9.81t + C$, so $v(0) = C = 4$. And
	
	$$
		h(t) = \int v(t)\,dt = \int (-9.81t + 4)\,dt = -4.905t^2 + 4t + C,
	$$
	
	so $h(0) = C = 1$. Therefore, $h(t) = -4.905t^2 + 4t + 1$.
