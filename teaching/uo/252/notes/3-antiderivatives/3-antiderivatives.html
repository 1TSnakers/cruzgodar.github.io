!begin-text-block
	
	We need to take a brief deviation from definite integrals to develop something slightly different. It won&#x2019;t seem to have any relation at first, but in the next section, we&#x2019;ll relate it back to our main goal.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	antiderivative
	
	Let $f$ be a function. A function $F$ is an <dfn>antiderivative</dfn> of $f$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	antiderivatives
	
	$F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}$ is an antiderivative of $f(x) = x^2$, since $F'(x) = f(x)$. So is $G(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + 2$, since the $2$ differentiates to zero. Similarly, for any constant $C$, $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$ is an antiderivative of $x^2$. In fact, <strong>all</strong> antiderivatives of $f$ have this form.
	
!end-example



!begin-thm
	
	classification of antiderivatives
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function with an antiderivative $F(x)$. Then all antiderivatives of $f$ are of the form $F(x) + C$.
	
!end-thm

!begin-text-block
	
	It&#x2019;d be nice to have some notation to represent the operation of taking an antiderivative &mdash; something akin to $\frac{d}{dx}$. As strange as it might seem right now, we&#x2019;re actually going to use the integral symbol for this &mdash; despite how confusing that is, it&#x2019;ll actually simplify things for us in the end.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	indefinite integral
	
	Let $f$ be a function. The <dfn>indefinite integral</dfn> of $f$ is $\int f(x)\ dx = F(x) + C$, where $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	So the only notational difference between the definite integral that measures area under a graph and the indefinite integral that takes an antiderivative is that the former is written with limits of integration &mdash; $\int_a^b f(x)\ dx$ &mdash; and the latter isn&#x2019;t &mdash; $\int f(x)\ dx$. Again, this should seem like an awful choice of notation, but bear with it for now.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	indefinite integrals
	
	$\int \frac{1}{t}\ dt = \ln |t| + C$.
	
	$\int \sin(x)\ dx = -\cos(x) + C$.
	
	$\int e^u\ du = e^u + C$.
	
	$\int x^p\ dx = \frac{x^{p + 1}}{p + 1} + C$ if $p \neq -1$.
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	indefinite integrals
	
	Find the following.
	
	$\int \frac{1}{t^2}\ dt$.
	
	$\int \sec^2(y)\ dy$.
	
	$\int (mx + b)\ dx$.
	
!end-exercise



!begin-text-block
	
	Because derivatives factor through addition and multiplication by a constant, so do antiderivatives.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	properties of indefinite integrals
	
	1. $\int (f(x) + g(x))\ dx = \int f(x)\ dx + \int g(x)\ dx$.
	
	2. $\int c \cdot f(x)\ dx = c\int f(x)\ dx$.
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	One immediate use of indefinite integrals is to solve <dfn>initial value problems</dfn> &mdash; problems of the form
	
	$$y'(x) = f(x)$$
	
	$$y(x_0) = y_0$$
	
	The idea is that we can solve for $y$ by integrating $f(x)$, but that will leave the constant $C$ in our solution, which we can solve for with the second equation (called the <dfn>initial value</dfn>).
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	an initial value problem
	
	You&#x2019;re driving a car. After $t$ seconds, your velocity in meters per second is given by $v(t) = 3t + 2$. After one second, you've moved $2$ meters. Find a function $s(t)$ that gives your distance traveled after $t$ seconds.
	
	Since $v'(t) = s(t)$, we have that $s(t) = \int v(t)\ dt = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t + C$. Now since $s(1) = 2$, we can solve for $C$: $\frac{3}{2} + 2 + C = 2$, so $C = -\frac{3}{2}$. In total, $s(t) = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t - \frac{3}{2}$.
	
!end-example



!begin-exercise
	
	an initial value problem
	
	You throw a ball straight up. Acceleration due to gravity is always $a(t) = -9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$. The ball leaves your hand $1$ meter off the ground with a velocity of $2 \frac{m}{s}$. Find a function $h(t)$ that gives the height of the ball above the ground $t$ seconds after leaving your hand.
