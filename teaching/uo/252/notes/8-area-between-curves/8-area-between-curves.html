!begin-text-block
	
	Up to this point, we&#x2019;ve defined integrals via Riemann sums, related them to antiderivatives via the Fundamental Theorem, and then made taking antiderivatives a little easier with $u$-sub. Now, we&#x2019;ll extend what definite integrals can do by exploring how they can calculate area not just under a curve, but between two of them.

!begin-prop
	
	area between curves
	
	Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be functions with $f(x) \geq g(x)$ when $a \leq x \leq b$. Then the area between the graphs of $f$ and $g$ on $[a, b]$
	
	$$\int_a^b (f(x) - g(x))\ dx.$$
