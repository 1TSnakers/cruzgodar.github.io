!header Simple Applications



!begin-text-block
	
	With the hardest conceptual work behind us, let&#x2019;s turn to some simple applications of integrals. The first is one we&#x2019;ve touched on before, and that you probably saw plenty of in calc I: the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration. Recall that <dfn>displacement</dfn> means signed distance: if you move $3$ meters right and $2$ left, then your net displacement is only $1$ meter, while your total distance traveled is $5$.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	displacement
	
	A particle is traveling in a straight line with a velocity of $v(t) = 3t - 5 \frac{m}{s}$ after $t$ seconds. Find the net displacement of the particle over $3$ seconds and its total distance traveled.
	
	Let&#x2019;s start with net displacement, which is $s(3) - s(0)$. Since $s$ is an antiderivative of $v$, we have that
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			s(3) - s(0) &= \int_0^3 v(t)\ dt\\
			&= \int_0^3 (3t - 5)\ dt\\
			&= \left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_0^3\\
			&= \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 9 - 15 \right) - 0\\
			&= -\frac{3}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, the particle ended up $1.5$ meters to the left of where it started after $3$ seconds.
	
	This is just the end result, though, and it doesn't tell us how much the particle moved in total. For that, there&#x2019;s an easy change we can make: rather than integrating $v$, which is sometimes negative and sometimes positive, we&#x2019;ll integrate $|v|$. This makes all velocity count as positive, whether it&#x2019;s to the left or right, and so integrating that will give us total distance traveled. There&#x2019;s some nuance to just taking that absolute value, though, because we need to know when $v$ is positive and when it&#x2019;s negative. To do this, we&#x2019;ll first set it equal to zero: if $3t - 5 = 0$, then $t = \frac{5}{3}$, and since $v$ is a line with positive slope, it must be negative for $t &lt; \frac{5}{3}$ and positive for $t > \frac{5}{3}$. In order to take the absolute value, we need to negate $v$ when it&#x2019;s negative and not when it&#x2019;s positive. This means doing different things on different parts of the domain, so we need to split up the integral itself. If we let $s_{\text{tot}}(t)$ be the total distance traveled after $t$ seconds, then we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			s_{\text{tot}}(3) - s_{\text{tot}}(0) &= \int_0^3 |v(t)|\ dt\\
			&= \int_0^{\frac{5}{3}} -v(t)\ dt + \int_{\frac{5}{3}}^3 v(t)\ dt\\
			&= -\int_0^{\frac{5}{3}} (3t - 5)\ dt + \int_{\frac{5}{3}}^3 (3t - 5)\ dt\\
			&= -\left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_0^{\frac{5}{3}} + \left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_{\frac{5}{3}}^3\\
			&= -\left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{9} - \frac{25}{3} \right) - 0 + \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 9 - 15 \right) - \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{9} - \frac{25}{3} \right)\\
			&= \frac{41}{6}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The particle therefore traveled a total of $\frac{41}{6} \approx 6.83$ meters total.

!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s finish the section with something a little easier. You might have seen even and odd functions before, but we&#x2019;ll briefly review what they are.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	even and odd functions
	
	A function $f$ is <dfn>even</dfn> if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, and <dfn>odd</dfn> if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	Geometrically, even functions are ones whose graphs are symmetric about the $y$-axis and odd functions are ones whose graphs are symmetric when rotated 180 degrees about the origin. For example, $x^4 - x^2$ is even, while $x^3$ is odd.
	
!end-text-block



!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xch7oxgfa4



!begin-prop
	
	integrals of even and odd functions
	
	Let $f$ be an even function. Then $\int_{-a}^a f(x)\ dx = 2\int_0^a f(x)\ dx.$
	
	Let $g$ be an odd function. Then $\int_{-a}^a f(x)\ dx = 0.$
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	This shouldn&#x2019;t be terribly surprising. If a function is even and we&#x2019;re integrating over an interval centered at $0$, then the total area is evenly split over the parts to the left and right of $x = 0$. If the function is odd, then those two areas exactly cancel out instead.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	integrals of even and odd functions
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{-2}^2 (x^4 - x^2)\ dx &= 2\int_0^3 (x^4 - x^2)\ dx\\
			&= 2 \left. \left[ \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^2\\
			&= 2 \left(\frac{32}{5} - \frac{8}{3}\right)\\
			&= \frac{112}{15}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	And
	
	$$
		\int_{-2}^2 (x^5)\ dx = 0.
	$$
