	Welcome to Math 252! You&#x2019;re viewing the interactive lecture notes &mdash; reading either these or the textbook is required for the class, since we&#x2019;ll have a very short reading quiz on Canvas due before each lecture. To get started, let&#x2019;s make sure your browser handles equations and graphs correctly. You should see an equation on its own line below and a graph below that.
	
	$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

	If anything doesn&#x2019;t appear correctly, update your browser and then reach out if that doesn&#x2019;t work. There&#x2019;s also a non-interactive pdf version of each document available for compatibility &mdash; let me know if you need them.

!text s Limits

<br>

!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s talk about Calc I. There are two main concepts taught there that we&#x2019;ll need in this course: limits and derivatives. We&#x2019;ll skip the formal definition of a limit in favor of the intuitive one: $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ is the value that $f(a)$ &#x201C;should&#x201D; have. Should is in quotes because $f(a)$ doesn&#x2019;t actually need to have that value &mdash; or any value. Instead, we take a limit by sliding $x$ closer and closer to $a$, from either above or below, and seeing what value $f(x)$ gets close to. In the graph below, $f(2) = 5$, since there&#x2019;s a hole in the graph at $(2, 4)$. But as $x$ gets closer to $2$ from the right or the left, $f(x)$ gets closer to $4$, so $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 4$.

!begin-text-block
	
	There&#x2019;s a sense in which the behavior of the previous example is pathological (i.e. unusual). &#x201C;Nice&#x201D; functions shouldn&#x2019;t have holes in them or strange things like that, and it turns out that what we mean by &#x201C;nice&#x201D; is <dfn>continuous</dfn>.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	continuity
	
	A function $f$ is <dfn>continuous</dfn> if for all $a$ in its domain, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.
	
!end-def



!begin-text-block
	
	Continuous functions are ones that can be drawn without lifting up your pencil &mdash; there are no holes or jumps. Recall that the <dfn>domain</dfn> of a function is the collection of $x$-values for which $f(x)$ is defined &mdash; we need that in the definition so that $f(a)$ makes sense to write. In the example below, the red function $f(x)$ is continuous while the blue function $g(x)$ is not.
	
!end-text-block



!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/g0pgjrwv3p



!begin-example
	
	limits
	
	Find $g(0)$, $g(1)$, $g(3)$, $\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x)$, $\lim_{x \to 1^+} g(x)$, and $\lim_{x \to 1} g(x)$.
	
	The first three can be read directly off the graph. Try clicking or tapping the relevant points!
	
	$g(0) = -1$.
	
	$g(1)$ is undefined, since there is no solid point with $x = 1$.
	
	$g(3) = -\dfrac{2}{3}$.
	
	For the limits, remember that the superscript plus or minus indicates a direction to approach from. So $\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x) = 0$, since we only look at the graph to the left (because of the $1^-$) of $x = 1$. Similarly, $\lim_{x \to 1^+} g(x) = -1$. When we remove that superscript, we get $\lim_{x \to 1} g(x)$, which is actually undefined. This is because in order for a limit to exist, the limits from both the left and right have to exist and be equal to one another, and here they aren&#x2019;t.

!text s Derivatives

<br>

!begin-text-block
	
	The <dfn>derivative</dfn> of a function $f(x)$ is a function we call $f'(x)$, defined as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $x$. Not all functions are differentiable &mdash; in order for one to be, it must be continuous and not have any sharp corners. The red function in the graph below is differentiable, while both functions in the previous graph aren&#x2019;t. Drag the red point around below to show the tangent line to $f$ &mdash; its slope is the value of $f'(x)$.
	
!end-text-block



!iframe https://www.desmos.com/calculator/canjr6j4jb



!begin-text-block
	
	Now&#x2019;s a good time to mention that most of the graphs are editable &mdash; for example, you can change the formula of $f(x)$ to any other differentiable function in the previous graph. Try changing it to $\sin(x)$!
	
	Let&#x2019;s write the formal definition of a derivative, which is defined to be the limit of slopes of secant lines, and then a handful of common derivative formulas.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	the derivative
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function. The <dfn>derivative</dfn> of $f$ at $x = a$, if it exists, is
	
	$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.$$
	
!end-def



!begin-prop
	
	basic derivative rules
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot f'(x)$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$ (the product rule)
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$ (the quotient rule)
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ (the chain rule)
	
!end-prop



!begin-example
	
	the chain rule
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x^3)] &= \left( \frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]|_{x^3} \right) \left( \frac{d}{dx} [x^3] \right)\\
			&= 3x^2 \cos(x^3)
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Some notational quirks to remember: $\frac{d}{dx}$ means derivative with respect to $x$, the $|_{x^3}$ tells us to plug $x^3$ in for $x$ after we take a derivative, and the derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$. While we&#x2019;re talking about slightly obscure formulas like that, here&#x2019;s a short list of good derivatives to know.
	
!end-example



!begin-prop
	
	common derivatives
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [0] = 0$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [x^p] = px^{p - 1}, p \neq 0$ (the power rule)
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)] = \cos(x)$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [b^x] = b^x \ln(b)$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [e^x] = e^x$
	
	$\frac{d}{dx} [\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}$
	
!end-prop



!begin-text-block
	
	Derivatives measure rates of change, so the classic example (in fact, what their original purpose was) is that if $s(t)$ measures the position of something at time $t$, then $s'(t) = v(t)$, the velocity at time $t$, and $s''(t) = v'(t) = a(t)$, the acceleration at time $t$.
	
	Derivatives are commonly used to find <dfn>extrema</dfn> of functions, which are local maxima or minima. To do this, we find all of a function&#x2019;s critical points: the $x$-values that make the derivative zero or undefined. To determine whether a critical point is a maximum or minimum, we can use the <dfn>second derivative test</dfn>: since the second derivative measures concavity, if $f''(x) > 0$ for a critical point $x$, then the critical point is a local minimum, and if $f''(x) &lt; 0$, then it&#x2019;s a local maximum. The example below has the critical points marked and the second derivative graphed too.
	
	Speaking of the second derivative, $x$-values that make <em>it</em> zero are called <dfn>inflection points</dfn>, and indicate a change in concavity. In the example below, $f(x)$ is concave down to the left of the inflection point and concave up to the right of it.

	You can click the colored circles next to functions to temporarily hide them if the graphs get too crowded.
	
	This is just about everything we&#x2019;ll need from Calc I. The last bit is <dfn>L&#x2019;H&#x00F4;pital&#x2019;s rule</dfn>, which lets us calculate difficult limits with derivatives.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-prop
	
	L&#x2019;H&#x00F4;pital&#x2019;s rule
	
	If $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is either $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, then $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$. Note this is <em>only</em> allowed when the limit is originally in one of these indeterminate forms, and that we differentiate the top and bottom of the fraction separately, rather than use the quotient rule.
	
!end-prop



!begin-example
	
	L&#x2019;H&#x00F4;pital&#x2019;s rule
	
	$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{\infty}{\infty}$, so $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{2x} = 0$.
	
!end-example



!begin-text-block
	
	That&#x2019;s it! If some or most of this feels unfamiliar, take some time to work through a couple example problems out of volume I of the textbook and mess around with the graphs on this page.
