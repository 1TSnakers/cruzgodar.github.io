Material for the courses I'm teaching and have previously taught. Throughout my years of teaching, I've written a substantial amount of detailed and interactive notes, complete with graphs and animations. I regularly use and update these, and I've been happy to know both students and teachers alike that have made use of them. If you have comments or suggestions on anything here, please don't hesitate to reach out!

My office hours for Spring 2025 are M 3--3:50, TR 1--1:50, F 12--12:50 in the Fenton Hall atrium (the middle of the third floor). While they're of course primarily for current students, if you've taken one of my classes or used my notes in the past, you're always more than welcome!
