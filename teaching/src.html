# Teaching

Material for the classes I'm teaching and have previously taught. For Math 251 and above, I've written detailed and interactive notes, complete with embedded graphs --- even if you're not taking one of those classes, they're useful for reviewing or previewing topics.

My office hours for Winter 2023 are MW 1&ndash;1:50 and F 2&ndash;2:50 in the Fenton Hall atrium (the middle of the third floor). While they're of course primarily for current students, if you've taken one of my classes or used my notes in the past, you're always more than welcome!
