While we have textbooks for this class, they are completely optional. Between the notes and homework on the website, we have everything the textbook would provide, but with the benefit of staying much more in sync with the course. If you&#x2019;d like books regardless, either for extra practice problems beyond the homework or just a different perspective on the course material, the freely-available <a href="https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Calculus_Volume_3_-_WEB.pdf">Calculus Volume 3</a> by Herman and Strang is a good resource for the calculus portion of the course. For the linear algebra portion, <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra">3Blue1Brown&#x2019;s video series</a> is a fantastic expository resource. For a more traditional textbook experience, <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/document/Nicholson-Linear+Algebra+with+Applications2018.pdf">Linear Algebra with Applications</a> by Nicholson is free and will do nicely.</p><p class="body-text">You might find a scientific calculator useful for simple calculations on the homework; I heartily endorse the free online <a href="https://www.desmos.com/scientific">Desmos scientific calculator</a>. On quizzes and exams, you can use a scientific calculator, but not a graphing one. The quizzes and exams are written so that necessary computations are doable by hand.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What will I be graded on?</h2><p class="body-text">Your grade is determined by your class participation and scores on a number of different assignments, weighted as follows:</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>In-class participation: 5%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>Reading quizzes: 5%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>In-class quizzes: 10%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>Homework: 15%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>Midterm 1: 20%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>Midterm 2: 20%</p><p class="body-text"><span style="width: 32px"></span>Final: 25%</p><p class="body-text">More on all of these in the coming sections! Your final class grade will be rounded up to the next integer &mdash; for example, a final grade of 88.2% will be rounded to 89% and awarded a B+.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What will class meetings be like?</h2><p class="body-text">We&#x2019;ll spend our class time covering the material from the notes. You&#x2019;ll need to read the notes on your own <em>before</em> coming to class, since there will be reading quizzes on Canvas. These ask for easy-to-find knowledge from the notes like definitions and theorem statements, and are there so that you&#x2019;ve seen the material at least once before lecture.</p><p class="body-text">The notes also contain exercises, color-coded blue. We&#x2019;ll do each of these in class as 1-2-4 group work &mdash; you&#x2019;ll first have a few minutes to begin the problem on your own, and then you&#x2019;ll get into pairs for the bulk of the time to compare your approaches and finish the problem together on separate sheets of paper. After that, you&#x2019;ll compare with another pair of students and explain your processes to one another. You&#x2019;ll turn your paper in at the end of class with your name and your partner&#x2019;s for participation credit (i.e. you won&#x2019;t be graded on correctness). As we progress through the notes, I&#x2019;ll also update them with solutions to past exercises to help with reviewing material.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What will the homework be like?</h2><p class="body-text">The homework is available on this site, and there will be roughly 20&ndash;30 problems due each week, due on Tuesdays (starting in week 2). Your grade is out of 20 points &mdash; 8 points are for thoroughly attempting every problem regardless of whether your answers are correct, and I&#x2019;ll select three problems per homework to be graded on correctness for 4 points each.</p><p class="body-text">All of our homework is submitted through Gradescope. One option is to handwrite your work and then scan it with a scanning app that produces PDFs (e.g. the scanner in the Files app on iOS or Adobe Scan on Android). Another option that I highly recommend is to try typing your homework with Latex. This is how scientific papers and books (and our notes and homework) are written, and it has the benefit of being easily editable if you make a mistake part of the way through a problem. The simplest way to get started is to make an account at <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>, and to make things as easy as possible, there&#x2019;s an option to download every homework as a Latex file. Typing your homework is completely optional, but I encourage you to give it a shot! If you plan to go into any STEM field, this is something you&#x2019;ll have to learn eventually, and it&#x2019;s a lot easier than you might expect.</p><p class="body-text">I also highly recommend studying and working on homework in groups. While the final work you submit must be your own, it&#x2019;s both helpful and great practice to work with others &mdash; part of the reason we have group work is to help build those friendships!</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What about generative AI?</h2><p class="body-text">Modern LLMs (large language models) increasingly have the ability to create and solve math problems, including more abstract questions that require complex reasoning. These tools can be profoundly useful, and I sometimes make use of them myself when programming. In the context of a college course, however, it is strikingly easy to undermine your own learning with them. LLMs in their current form fundamentally cannot be guaranteed to produce correct answers, but much more importantly, relying on them to complete homework assignments is one of the most effective ways to set yourself up for failure: the homework exists to challenge and prepare you for the in-class assignments, which are worth most of the credit. To that end, I treat using AI tools to complete the homework similarly to looking at the homework answers of a student who has already passed the course: the final work you submit must be entirely your own, and submitting either answers copied verbatim from an LLM and/or answers you don&#x2019;t fully understand is a form of academic misconduct.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What should I expect from the quizzes and exams?</h2><p class="body-text">We have quizzes on Tuesdays during the last 15 minutes of class, starting in week 2. The quizzes are designed to be barometers for the exams &mdash; if you&#x2019;re doing well on the quizzes, you can expect to do well on the exams, and if not, it&#x2019;s an early indicator that you may want to adjust your study strategies.</p><p class="body-text">Our midterm exams are on October 7th and November 11th and take up the full 75 minutes of class. The midterms are cumulative and typically have multiple-choice and short-answer portions, as well as longer multi-part questions. I reserve the right to assign seating for the quizzes and exams.</p><p class="body-text">Our final exam is cumulative and is at 7 PM on Monday, December 15th.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What are the best things I can do to succeed?</h2><p class="body-text">In and around the course, the most important things to focus on are (fittingly) the ones worth credit: coming to class and completing the homework early are crucial to staying on top of all the material. Outside of class, you should expect to spend at least 8 hours per week on homework and studying if you&#x2019;re fully comfortable with all of the prerequisites for the class, and more than that if not. Mathematics broadly is a challenging subject, and this course should challenge every student at some point &mdash; so don&#x2019;t panic when that happens! It&#x2019;s just an indication that you may want to devote more time to the course (at least temporarily).</p><p class="body-text">Beyond the assignments worth credit, the single best thing you can do is <strong>show up to at least one office hour per week</strong>. Regularly coming to office hours is a great way to make sure you&#x2019;re putting in that time &mdash; even if you don&#x2019;t have any questions, it&#x2019;s a communal environment where you can focus on homework and get help if any questions do come up, or just talk about anything at all related to the class or math more broadly. I schedule my office hours with the goal of enabling every student to attend at least one, but if none of my scheduled office hours work for you, please feel free to email me to schedule a time to meet outside of them!</p><p class="body-text">Outside of the course, please take care of your mental, physical and emotional health; it&#x2019;s both far more important than and necessary for your success in this course! Yale offers many resources to support you in these ways &mdash; a good place to start is <a href="https://yalewell.yale.edu">Yale Well</a>.</p><p class="body-text">Speaking of resources, there are also so many to help you succeed academically! Our course has a peer tutor &mdash; Nathan Mak &mdash; who is a fellow Yale undergraduate and will hold regular tutoring sessions at the following times:</p><p class="body-text">If these times don&#x2019;t work for you, there is also <a href="https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/learning/help-with-stem/stem-tutoring">drop-in tutoring available at the Poorvu center</a>.</p><p class="body-text">Student Accessibility Services is an excellent resource that helps students with varied learning challenges succeed and thrive academically. If you&#x2019;re already registered with SAS, please forward your accommodation letter to me as soon as possible, ideally in week 1. If you think SAS could be a benefit to you, please <a href="https://sas.yale.edu/students/accommodations/exams">reach out to them</a>! It can take a little while before everything goes through, so the sooner the better.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">What are the skills I can expect to learn from this course?</h2><p class="body-text">As a first-year college course, we have a wide range of learning goals!

The quizzes can&#x2019;t be taken late, but they can be taken early &mdash; if you won&#x2019;t be available one Wednesday, just let me know a few days in advance. Due to UO&#x2019;s reason-neutral excuse policy, no make-ups will be offered for any assignment. However, your lowest two homeworks, two quizzes, two reading quizzes, and two weeks of participation grades will be dropped, and your final exam score will replace the lower of your two midterm scores if it helps.</p><h2 class="section-text" style="margin-top: 80px">Is there anything else I should know?</h2><p class="body-text">Like most graduate students, I am a <a href="https://investigations.uoregon.edu/employee-responsibilities">designated reporter</a>, which means I am required to report many types of sensitive information. Please see the link for more details.</p><p class="body-text">A brief word on conduct: this university exists for your benefit! If there is something that could be improved, please don&#x2019;t hesitate to let me know. In turn, university students are also held to a high standard. Academic dishonesty in any form &mdash; submitting others&#x2019; work as your own, using prohibited materials on quizzes or exams, etc. &mdash; will not be tolerated.</p></div></section></main>
