It&#x2019;s also a terminal course in the math department, and it&#x2019;s used primarily as preparation for higher-level courses in economics and statistics. All this means that the course is a unique perspective on two somewhat distinct areas of math that share one main thing in common: they concern functions of multiple variables. In the first half of this course, we&#x2019;ll explore how the ideas and techniques of calculus I &mdash; specifically optimization &mdash; apply to functions that take more than a single variable as input. In the second half, we&#x2019;ll apply our experience with higher-dimensional space to cover an introduction to linear algebra, exploring how formalizing and structuring methods to solve systems of linear equations results in a surprisingly rich and fully-featured theory that applies to far more than those systems. But before we get started with either of these, let&#x2019;s take our first section to familiarize ourselves with 3D coordinates, a language common to both linear algebra and multivariable calculus.</p><p class="body-text">We&#x2019;re used to functions of a single variable (which we often just call <em>functions</em>) of the form <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y = f(x)">$y = f(x)$.</span> They take in a real number <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> and output a real number <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$,</span> often according to some rule like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x) = x^2">$f(x) = x^2$.</span> When we graph functions like these, we plot pairs <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$,</span> with one <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$-coordinate</span> for every <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$-coordinate</span> we can plug in.</p><p class="body-text">Plenty of real-world functions take in more than one input though &mdash; a fluid has viscosity that is a function of both temperature and pressure, a company producing multiple products that require overlapping resources has profit that is a function of the amounts of each product produced, and maybe most directly, height above sea level is a function of latitude and longitude.</p><p class="body-text">We could define a brand-new notion of a function of two or more variables and proceed to redevelop many of the same results we already know to be true about single-variable functions, but there&#x2019;s a better way, and a good lesson to learn about math more broadly: whenever reasonable, it pays to leverage notions and language that&#x2019;s already established rather than making something new from scratch. To that end, let&#x2019;s think of a function that takes two inputs in a slightly different way: as a function that takes in a <em>single</em> pair of real numbers <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$</span> and outputs a real number <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="z">$z$.</span> That way, most of what we already know about single-variable functions will carry over to these new ones.</p><p class="body-text">To distinguish and denote these functions, though, we&#x2019;re in desperate need of notation and language!
