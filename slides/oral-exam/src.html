		<h1>Background</h1>
		
		<p class="build">A <dfn>partition</dfn> of an integer $n$ is a sequence $(a_1, a_2, ... )$ of decreasing nonnegative integers $a_i$ with $\sum_i a_i = n$.</p>
		
		<p class="build">Ex: $(5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...)$ is a partition of $13$.</p>
		
		<p class="build">The <dfn>Young diagram</dfn> corresponding to a partition $(a_i)$ is the set $\{(i, j) \in \mathbb{N}^2 \mid 1 \leq j \leq a_i\}$.</p>
		
		<p class="build">We usually treat these as top-left-justified sets of squares in a grid, so that $a_i$ is the length of row $i$.</p>

		<h1>Plane Partitions</h1>
		
		<p class="build">A <dfn>plane partition</dfn> is a placement of nonnegative integers into a Young diagram, such that the rows and columns weakly decrease. We can also think of them as a stacks of boxes, with each number indicating how many boxes are stacked on that square.</p>
		
		<p class="build">The <dfn>weight</dfn> of a plane partition $\pi$, written $|\pi|$, is just the sum of its entries, or equivalently the total number of boxes stacked.</p>
		
		<p class="build">If we require the rows and columns of a plane partition to weakly <em>increase</em> rather than decrease, the resulting object is called a <dfn>reverse plane partition</dfn>, or RPP.</p>

		<h1>Hooks and Hook Lengths</h1>
		
		<p class="build">The <dfn>hook</dfn> corresponding to a box in an APP is the right-angled collection of boxes above and to the left of it. The hook length $h(i, j)$ of a box is the total number of boxes in its hook.</p>
		
		<p class="build">In an RPP, the direction of hooks is reserved along with the inequalities, and they extend down and right instead.</p>
