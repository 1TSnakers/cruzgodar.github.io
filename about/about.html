	cruzgodar.com is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('https://pages.github.com', true)">GitHub Pages</a>, which is a great way to host static websites for free. I wrote the code from scratch rather than use a site like Wordpress, which does little more than charge a steep price just to take away control. My goal was to create a site that used modern web technologies to their fullest extent while still being clean, fast and lightweight; to that end, it doesn&#x2019;t use templates like Bootstrap, and it&#x2019;s written in plain and simple HTML, not some abstract language that compiles to it. The few required libraries are simple and small, and notably, jQuery is not among them.

	I made sure to design the site with privacy in mind. There are no cookies of any kind, and everything runs locally, with no backend. There&#x2019;s no data being mined and no ads tracking you.

	Creating a website from the ground up like this is a good way to learn about programming and graphic design, and it&#x2019;s also just a satisfying hobby. If you&#x2019;re interested in the code, the repo is <a href="https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io', true)">here</a>, and a complete documentation of how everything works is <a href="https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io/blob/master/docs/overview.md" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io/blob/master/docs/overview.md', true)">here</a>. Consider crediting me if you use something large like an entire page layout in your own project.

	One final note: this site is built only for the latest versions of popular browsers because backwards compatibility is more trouble than it&#x2019;s worth. If something isn&#x2019;t working, first make sure your browser is updated, then file an issue <a href="https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io/issues/new" onclick="Page.Navigation.redirect('https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io/issues/new', true)">here</a>.
