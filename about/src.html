!header About



!begin-text-block
	
	I grew up in San Luis Obispo, a small town in California almost exactly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. I was homeschooled and took to math at an early age, and by the time I was eleven, I was interested in taking a few classes at the local community college. I was surprised to find it wasn&#x2019;t completely out of the question &mdash; I was able to register as an enrichment student, and although I was limited to eleven units a semester, that was plenty. Being surrounded by students five or ten or forty years older than me was a unique experience, and one that took a little while to adapt to, but I settled in before too long. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually transfered to Cal Poly, the local university. It demanded a lot more of me, but I made it through two years of classes and research and found a community in the math lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I started thinking about writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated in Spring 2018 with honors, and I chose to take a gap year to travel to Germany, where I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country. I returned and relaxed &mdash; and worked on this site &mdash; over the following summer, before packing up my life and moving to Oregon to attend grad school. For the next six years, I&#x2019;m here to stay.

!text s Projects

<br>

!begin-text-block

	<a href="/applets/"><strong>Interactive Math Applets</strong></a>: created more than 30 interactive JavaScript applets for exploring fractals and other beautiful objects in math. Whenever possible, the applets use WebGL and WebAssembly for extremely high performance, and modern tools like WebWorkers and promises for simple and organized code. Still images and animations from them have been featured in five exhibitions, including the <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-Bridges-Conference">2022 Bridges conference</a>.
	
	<a href="/teaching/"><strong>Interactive Class Notes</strong></a>: written full class notes for Calculus I, II, and III, incorporating MathJax to render equations and the Desmos API to include graphs. The design is fully responsive, so students can just as easily view them with a phone as with a laptop.

	<a href="https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io"><strong>Personsal Website</strong></a>: written a website from scratch without using large libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. Everything from the single-page site logic to the graphic design was made custom from the ground up, and the site currently contains a total of over 50000 lines of JavaScript.
	
	<a href="https://github.com/90259025/lapsa"><strong>Lapsa</strong></a>: created an HTML-based presentation engine, featuring easy building-in of both HTML elements and JS functions, a table view that integrates with both kinds of builds, and easy and powerful customization with CSS.
	
	<a href="https://github.com/90259025/wilson"><strong>Wilson</strong></a>: written a JavaScript library for making many kinds of web applets easier to create by streamlining features like WebGL, mouse and touch input, and fullscreen support, all of which can be cumbersome to do manually. The Julia set explorer on the <a href="/projects/wilson/">example page</a> is feature-rich but written in under 300 lines of code.
