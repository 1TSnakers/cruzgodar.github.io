# About

I grew up in San Luis Obispo, a small town in California almost exactly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. I was homeschooled and took to math at an early age, and by the time I was eleven, I was interested in taking a few classes at the local community college. I was surprised to find it wasn&#x2019;t completely out of the question &mdash; I was able to register as an enrichment student, and although I was limited to eleven units a semester, that was plenty. Being surrounded by students five or ten or forty years older than me was a unique experience, and one that took a little while to adapt to, but I settled in before too long. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually transfered to Cal Poly, the local university. It demanded a lot more of me, but I made it through two years of classes and research and found a community in the math lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I started thinking about writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated in Spring 2018 with honors, and I chose to take a gap year to travel to Germany, where I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country. I returned and relaxed &mdash; and worked on this site &mdash; over the following summer, before packing up my life and moving to Oregon to attend grad school. For the next six years, I&#x2019;m here to stay.



## Education

**Ph.D. in Mathematics:** University of Oregon (2019&ndash;Present)

**M.S. in Mathematics:** University of Oregon (2021)

**B.S. in Mathematics:** California Polytechnic State University (2018)

**A.S. in Mathematics:** Cuesta College (2016)



## Interests

Standard, reverse, and asymptotic plane partitions, their connections to the single and double dimer models, and the RSK, Hillman-Grassl, and Pak-Sulzgruber correspondences between them. (<a href="/applets/plane-partitions/">Plane partitions applet</a>)

Data visualization and mathematical illustration, particularly with direct user interaction.

Machine learning and other processing of large data sets.

Graph theory, particularly large networks with power-law degree distributions.



## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages**

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; JavaScript

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; C

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; Python

**Tools and Packages**

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; WebGL (examples: <a href="/applets/the-mandelbulb/">the Mandelbulb</a>, <a href="/applets/double-pendulum-fractal/">the double pendulum fractal</a>, <a href="/applets/newtons-method/">Newton&#x2019;s method fractals</a>)

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; WebAssembly (examples: <a href="/applets/wilsons-algorithm/">Wilson&#x2019;s algorithm</a>, <a href="/applets/calcudoku-generator/">Calcudoku generator</a>)

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; CUDA

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; numpy

!<span style="width: 32px"></span>&#8226; Keras and TensorFlow



## Projects

**<a href="/applets/">Interactive Math Applets</a>**: created more than 30 interactive JavaScript applets for exploring fractals and other beautiful objects in math. Whenever possible, the applets use WebGL and WebAssembly for extremely high performance, and modern tools like WebWorkers and promises for simple and organized code. Still images and animations from them have been featured in five exhibitions, including the <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-Bridges-Conference">2022 Bridges conference</a>.

**<a href="/teaching/">Interactive Class Notes</a>**: written full class notes for Calculus I, II, and III, incorporating MathJax to render equations and the Desmos API to include graphs. The design is fully responsive, so students can just as easily view them with a phone as with a laptop.

**<a href="https://github.com/90259025/90259025.github.io">Personal Website</a>**: written a website from scratch without using large libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. Everything from the single-page site logic to the graphic design was made custom from the ground up, and the site currently contains a total of over 50000 lines of JavaScript.

**<a href="https://github.com/90259025/lapsa">Lapsa</a>**: created an HTML-based presentation engine, featuring easy building-in of both HTML elements and JS functions, a table view that integrates with both kinds of builds, and easy and powerful customization with CSS.

**<a href="https://github.com/90259025/wilson">Wilson</a>**: written a JavaScript library for making many kinds of web applets easier to create by streamlining features like WebGL, mouse and touch input, and fullscreen support, all of which can be cumbersome to do manually. The Julia set explorer on the <a href="/projects/wilson/">example page</a> is feature-rich but written in under 300 lines of code.



## Research Experience and Presentations

**Speaker: Nordic Congress of Mathematicians** (Aalto University, August 2022). Presented a talk on bijectivizing the PT-DT correspondence for plane partitions. Also presented an expanded version of the talk in the student combinatorics seminar at UO in November 2022.

**Graduate Research Assistant** (University of Oregon, June&ndash;September 2022). Worked with Professor Benjamin Young to investigate a bijective map between plane-partition-like objects.

**Summer Research Program** (California Polytechnic State University, June&ndash;September 2017). Worked with Professor Robert Easton to investigate a potential version of conic duality in tropical geometry.
