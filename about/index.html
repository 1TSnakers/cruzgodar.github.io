I was homeschooled and took to math at an early age, and by the time I was eleven, I was interested in taking a few classes at the local community college. I was surprised to find it wasn&#x2019;t completely out of the question &mdash; I was able to register as an enrichment student, and although I was limited to eleven units a semester, that was plenty. Being surrounded by students five or ten or forty years older than me was a unique experience, and one that took a little while to adapt to, but I settled in before too long. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually transfered to Cal Poly. It demanded a lot more of me, but I made it through two years of classes and research and found a community in the math lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I started thinking about writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated in Spring 2018 with honors, and I chose to take a gap year to travel to Germany, where I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country. I returned and relaxed &mdash; and worked on this site &mdash; over the following summer, before packing up my life and moving to Oregon to attend grad school. For the next six years, I&#x2019;m here to stay.</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Education</h2><section><p class="body-text"><strong>Ph.D. in Mathematics:</strong> University of Oregon (2019&ndash;Present)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>M.S. in Mathematics:</strong> University of Oregon (2021)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>B.S. in Mathematics:</strong> California Polytechnic State University (2018)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>A.S. in Mathematics:</strong> Cuesta College (2016)</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Interests</h2><section><p class="body-text">Standard, reverse, and asymptotic plane partitions, their connections to the single and double dimer models, and the RSK, Hillman-Grassl, and Pak-Sulzgruber correspondences between them.

Whenever possible, the applets use WebGL and WebAssembly for extremely high performance, and modern tools like WebWorkers and promises for simple and organized code. Still images and animations from them have been featured in five exhibitions, including the <a href="http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-Bridges-Conference">2022 Bridges conference</a>.</p><p class="body-text"><strong><a href="/teaching/">Interactive Class Notes</a></strong>: written full class notes for Calculus I, II, and III, incorporating MathJax to render equations and the Desmos API to include graphs.
