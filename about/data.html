I was homeschooled and took to math at an early age, and by the time I was eleven, I was interested in taking a few classes at the local community college. I was surprised to find it wasn&#x2019;t completely out of the question &mdash; I was able to register as an enrichment student, and although I was limited to eleven units a semester, that was plenty. Being surrounded by students five or ten or forty years older than me was a unique experience, and one that took a little while to adapt to, but I settled in before too long. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually transfered to Cal Poly. It demanded a lot more of me, but I made it through two years of classes and research and found a community in the math lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I started thinking about writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated in Spring 2018 with honors, and I chose to take a gap year to travel to Germany, where I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country. I returned and relaxed &mdash; and worked on this site &mdash; over the following summer, before packing up my life and moving to Oregon to attend grad school. For the next six years, I&#x2019;m here to stay.</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Education</h2><section><p class="body-text"><strong>Ph.D. in Mathematics:</strong> University of Oregon (2019&ndash;Present)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>M.S. in Mathematics:</strong> University of Oregon (2021)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>B.S. in Mathematics:</strong> California Polytechnic State University (2018)</p><p class="body-text"><strong>A.S. in Mathematics:</strong> Cuesta College (2016)</p></section><h2 class="section-text"> Interests</h2><section><p class="body-text">Standard, reverse, and asymptotic plane partitions, their connections to the single and double dimer models, and the RSK, Hillman-Grassl, and Pak-Sulzgruber correspondences between them.

Extremely supportive of students, you can tell he wants to see every student succeed and that meant a lot. His teaching style is serious when it needs to be, does not feel like you are punished if you don&#x2019;t know everything first time around, and actually has a personality while teaching that makes the class very engaging and fun to come to. 11/10 teacher would highly highly recommend and I want to see more teachers mirror his style.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 256: Intro to Differential Equations (Spring 2023)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The instructor for this course has genuinely been the most helpful instructor I&#x2019;ve had in my entire time at UO. He cares about making sure the students learn and understand the course material, is aware of the things students struggle with, and puts more focus on those things to make sure everyone is on track with the material. Overall, the instructor has been amazing this term.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 341: Linear Algebra (Fall 2023)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I like the online notes. I am glad Cruz goes to the trouble to make them for students. He is EXTREMELY receptive to suggestions and feedback. I was often really blunt about things that were/weren&#x2019;t working, or aspects of the course that could be improved/modified/changed to help my learning and ensure everything was as thorough as it could be. He always took my suggestions and ideas, which made me feel heard and supported and respected. In addition, it made me feel like he put my learning as his top priority.</p><p class="body-text">He is also very aware of when things need to be modified to fit the capability of the class, which is a very impressive skill as a teacher. He knows when certain things are too much, and communicates with the class to help reconcile. </p><p class="body-text">Also, I may have said this before, but his ability to draw straight lines and perfect circles on a chalk board is quite impressive.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 252: Calculus II (Winter 2022)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text"><em>Prompt: What specifically about the support from the instructor helped your learning?</em></p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The responses to questions in class, keeping us updated on any changes on assignments, little tidbits of extra knowledge [that] go outside the scope of the class, office hours were super helpful, 1 on 1 meetings were extremely beneficial. Overall one of the best teachers I have ever had all around, made the class enjoyable and made me want to come to class every day.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 256: Intro to Differential Equations (Spring 2023)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Cruz your website is literally perfection. I want to let you know that it makes life so much easier in comparison to the other canvas pages my other professors set up.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 341: Linear Algebra (Fall 2023)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Office hours were super helpful and helped answer any questions that came up during homework. He also makes it easy to ask questions because he genuinely doesn&#x2019;t treat any questions like a stupid question. Many teachers will say that there is no stupid questions, but then still make you feel like your question is stupid. He very much doesn&#x2019;t do this.</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 341: Linear Algebra (Fall 2023)</em></p></div><div class="carousel-entry"><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The website is very organized and I always know what I have to get done and what we will go over each day. The notes correlate perfectly with the homework assigned. In addition I appreciate the instructor[&#x2019;s] willingness to answer any questions. Unlike other courses I don&#x2019;t feel stupid for asking questions.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>Math 252: Calculus II (Spring 2021)</em></p></div></div><div class="carousel-dots"><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div><div class="carousel-dot"><div class="fill"></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div>
