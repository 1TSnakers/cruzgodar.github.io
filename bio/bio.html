				<p class="body-text">I was born in Healdsburg, California, and moved to San Luis Obispo after just a year. I was homeschooled, and took to math at an early age &mdash; my parents tell me I understood the concept of pi as it relates to circles when I was three. I started reading the same year, and that may be why I developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia" onclick="redirect('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia', 1)">grapheme-color synesthesia</a>, a curious, harmless condition that I consider myself fortunate to have.</p>

				<p class="body-text">I gathered a working knowledge in most subjects, but in math, I thrived, learning most of (high school) algebra by the time I was eleven. I started thinking about going further, and so it was that my parents and I began to learn about how an eleven-year-old could attend community college.</p>

				<p class="body-text">In the end, it was easier than we thought. Though it limited me to eleven units a semester, I was able to register as an enrichment student at Cuesta, our local community college. Being surrounded by students ten or forty years older than me was a daunting experience, but one I adapted to quickly. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually applied and was accepted to Cal Poly, the local university. I was thrilled.</p>

				<p class="body-text">Cal Poly was far more challenging than Cuesta, but I made it through two years of classes and research, even finding a community in the university&#x2019;s Math Lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I began playing with the idea of writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated from Cal Poly in Spring 2018 with honors.</p>

				<p class="body-text">cruzgodar.com is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" onclick="redirect('https://pages.github.com', 1)">GitHub Pages</a>, which is a great way to host static websites for free. I wrote the code from scratch after deciding that all websites like Wordpress seem to do is charge a hefty sum just to take control away from the user. This site doesn&#x2019;t use templates like Bootstrap, and it&#x2019;s written in plain, simple HTML, not an abstract language that compiles to it. The only required libraries are <a href="https://jquery.com" onclick="redirect('https://jquery.com', true)">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/" onclick="redirect('https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/', true)">AOS</a>, and <a href="https://modernizr.com" onclick="redirect('https://modernizr.com', true)">Modernizr</a>, all of them simple and small.</p>
