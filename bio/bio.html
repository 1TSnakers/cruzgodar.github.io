				<p class="body-text">I was born in Healdsburg, California, grew up in San Luis Obispo, was homeschooled, and took to math at an early age &mdash; apparently I understood how pi relates to circles when I was three. I started reading around that time, and that may be why I developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia" onclick="redirect('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia', 1)">grapheme-color synesthesia</a>, a harmless condition that I&#x2019;ve come to appreciate having.</p>

				<p class="body-text">My childhood was like any other for the most part, but I was drawn to math enough that by the time I was eleven, I started thinking about taking a few classes at the local community college &mdash; and when I looked into it, I was surprised to see that wasn&#x2019;t completely out of the question.</p>

				<p class="body-text">In the end, it was easier than I thought. I was able to register as an enrichment student at Cuesta, and although I was limited to eleven units a semester, I didn&#x2019;t want to take on more work than that anyway. Being surrounded by students ten or forty years older than me was a unique experience, and one that took a little while to adapt to, but I settled in before too long. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually transfered to Cal Poly, the local university. I was thrilled.</p>

			<div data-aos="fade-up">
				<p class="body-text">Cal Poly demanded a lot more of me, but I made it through two years of classes and research, even finding a community in the university&#x2019;s Math Lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I began playing with the idea of writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated in Spring 2018 with honors.</p>

			<div data-aos="fade-up">
				<p class="body-text">I chose to take a gap year after graduating to travel to Germany, where I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country. I returned and relaxed over the following summer before packing up my life and moving to Oregon to attend grad school. And for the next six years, I&#x2019;m here to stay.</p>
