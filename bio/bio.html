			<div class="body-text">I was born in Healdsburg, California, and moved to San Luis Obispo after just a year. I was homeschooled, and took to math at an early age &mdash; my parents tell me I understood the concept of pi as it relates to circles when I was three. I started reading the same year, and that may be why I developed <span class="link" onclick="redirect('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme-color_synesthesia', 1)">grapheme-color synesthesia</span>, a curious, harmless condition that I consider myself fortunate to have.</div>

			<div class="body-text">I gathered a working knowledge in most subjects, but in math, I thrived, learning most of (high school) algebra by the time I was eleven. I started thinking about going further, and so it was that my parents and I began to learn about how an eleven-year-old could attend community college.</div>

			<div class="body-text">In the end, it was easier than we thought. Though it limited me to eleven units a semester, I was able to register as an enrichment student at Cuesta, our local community college. Being surrounded by students ten or forty years older than me was a daunting experience, but one I adapted to quickly. Over the next four years, I took twenty-one classes, worked as a tutor, and eventually applied and was accepted to Cal Poly, the local university. I was thrilled.</div>

		<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-anchor="#trigger-section-2">
			<div class="body-text">Cal Poly was far more challenging than Cuesta, but I made it through two years of classes and research, even finding a community in the university&#x2019;s Math Lounge. Toward the end of my first year, I began playing with the idea of writing a book, and I whittled an outline in my spare time over the following year. I graduated from Cal Poly in Spring 2018 with honors.</div>

			<div class="body-text">I chose to take a gap year before attending grad school to travel to Germany. There, I attended a language school for three months and traveled the country before returning and beginning preparation for grad school in the fall.</div>

			<div class="body-text">cruzgodar.com is hosted on <span class="link" onclick="redirect('https://pages.github.com', 1)">GitHub Pages</span>, which is a great way to host static websites for free. I wrote the code from scratch after seeing that all websites like Wordpress seem to do is charge a hefty sum just to take control away from the user. Creating a website from the ground up like this is both a great way to learn about both programming and graphic design and a relaxing and satisfying way to spend spare time. Take a look at the code if you&#x2019;re interested, and steal as much as you like, but consider crediting me if it&#x2019;s something big like a whole page layout.</div>
