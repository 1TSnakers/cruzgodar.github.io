HTMDL is a language similar to Markdown, but with support for straight HTML inline and a number of shortcuts. The following is a list of everything it supports.

Paragraphs are by default wrapped in `&lt;p class="body-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`. A single heading per file is allowed, with a line beginning with `#`, and sections are given by lines starting with `##`. Further headings are not allowed since three hash symbols indicate environments.

Display math is delimited by `$$`; it is automatically put in an `align*` environment so that `&` characters can be used freely. Line ends are automatically terminated with `\\\\`, and empty lines are culled.

Code blocks (with optional language tags) are delimited by `\`\`\``. Blocks that should be hidden unless in debug mode are delimited by `???`.



## Text

Lines beginning with a `&lt;` are treated as HTML and ignored; otherwise, the following replacement rules apply.

> - Math is delimited by dollar signs, and if delimited by `$$` instead, it is preceded with `\\displaystyle`.

> - Code is delimited by `\``.

> - Lines beginning with one or more `&gt;` are indented by that many tabs; if followed by a `-` character, they're bulleted.

> - Numbered lists can be written manually, but writing `#.` at the start of a line will replace it with the appropriate number in sequence, starting from one. Similarly, something like `4\#` will be replaced with `2--5`, where the start is the next number and the prefix to the hash gives the length of the range. Finally, `\#+n` and `\#-n` are converted to the numbers relative to the current position.



## Math

Within math environments, the following rules are used:

> - `\pe`, `\me`, and `\te` compile to appropriately-spaced $\pe$, $\me$, and $\te$.

> - `\span`, `\image`, `\swap`, `\Re`, `\Im`, `\proj` are all treated as operatornames.

> - Matrices like `[[ 1, 2, 3 ; 4, 5, 6 ]]` compile to $[[ 1, 2, 3 ; 4, 5, 6 ]]$.

> - Expressions like `:: a = 1 ; b = 1234 ::` are left aligned blocks: $\ :: a = 1 ; b = 1234 ::$

> - One-or-two variable Leibniz derivatives like `d/dx`, `dy/dx`, `d\theta/dx` convert to $d/dx$, $dy/dx$, and $d\theta/dx$. `\d` not immediately followed by a letter (i.e. not a letter) is converted to an operator $\text{d}$.

> - `**A**` is converted to bold $**A**$, and `#A#` is converted to blackboard bold $#A#$.



## Environments

All environments begin with `### &lt;environemnt-name>`, and if they're multi-line, end with `###`.

Single-line environments:

> - `\#\#\# banner`: indicates that the page should have a banner at the top.
> - `### canvas [id]`: a canvas with the given id. If no id is given, it's an applet-style output-canvas.
> - `### center &lt;text>`: centered text.
> - `### desmos &lt;id>`: a Desmos graph with the given id.
> - `### dropdown &lt;id>`: a dropdown with the given id.
> - `### file-upload &lt;id> &lt;accept> [multiple]`: a file upload with the given id and accept type. If multiple is given, it's a multiple file upload.
> - `### image &lt;urls...>`: an image with the given urls. If no urls are given, it's a placeholder.
> - `### nav-buttons`: a set of navigation buttons for the current page.
> - `### raymarch-controls`: a predefined applet controls card for raymarch applets.
> - `### solutions &lt;id>`: indicates that exercise solutions on the current notes page should be visisble in non-debug mode.
> - `### textarea &lt;id>`: a textarea with the given id.

Multi-line environments:

> - `### buttons`: a list of buttons. Each line is of the form `&lt;id>`.
> - `\#\#\# card &lt;id> &lt;title>`: a card with the given id and title. The body is the entire inside of the environment.
> - `### carousel`: a carousel. Each line within is a page of the carousel.
> - `### checkboxes`: a list of checkboxes. Each line is of the form `&lt;id>`.
> - `### gallery-block`: a gallery block. Each line is of the form `&lt;id> &lt;size>`.
> - `### image-links`: a list of image links, each of the form `&lt;url> [name] [cover-path] [-cet]`. If no name is given, it's the title of the page with the given url. If no cover-path is given, it's the cover of that page. `-c` indicates a card, `-t` opens in a new tab, and `-e` indicates an external link.
> - `### &lt;ex|exc|def|prop|thm|lem|cor|pf|ax|as> [title] [-m]`: a notes environment with the given title. The body is the entire inside of the environment. `-m` indicates a manual title (i.e. not automatically prefixed with things like "Theorem: ").
> - `### sliders`: a list of sliders, each of the form `id`.
> - `### text-boxes`: a list of text boxes, each of the form `id`.
