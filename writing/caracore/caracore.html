Cities that were once beacons have grown dim or been plunged into darkness altogether. One by one, the last fragments of humanity are being snuffed out.</p>

				<p class="synopsis-text">Los Angeles has fallen. Among the tiny fraction of citizens who survived, a particular half-dozen are scattered across the country, struggling to reach the same destination in very different ways. The thousands of miles in between are unyielding, and every one threatens to be the last, for out in the darkness, there is nothing to support life &mdash; no warmth, no light, no food, no water.</p>
