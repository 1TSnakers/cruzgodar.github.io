One by one, the last fragments of humanity are being snuffed out.</p><br><p class="synopsis-text">Los Angeles has fallen.

To have even the slightest chance, though, they&#x2019;ll need to make it to York. An entire country stands in the way, and the few individuals left populating it are unsavory at the very best.</p><p class="synopsis-text">The world lives and dies with their journey.</p><br><br><p class="body-text">Caracore is currently being written, with a goal of being finished in 2023. More information, including progress details, will be added here over time.</p></section></main><script>if (typeof Page === "undefined"){if (window.location.search !== ""){window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname) + "&" + window.location.search.slice(1));}else{window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname));}}Page.settings = {"title": "Caracore","small_margins_on_ultrawide": true,"manual_dark_theme": true};Page.load();</script></html>
