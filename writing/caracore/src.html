<p class="synopsis-text">What&#x2019;s left of the world doesn&#x2019;t look much like it used to. Massive mining operations dig ever deeper into the earth, seeking heat and energy. Cities that were once beacons have grown dim or been plunged into darkness altogether. One by one, the last fragments of humanity are being snuffed out.</p>

<p class="synopsis-text">Los Angeles has fallen. Among the tiny fraction of citizens who survived, a particular half-dozen are scattered across the country, struggling to reach the same destination in very different ways. The thousands of miles in between are unyielding, and every one threatens to be the last, for out in the darkness, there is nothing to support life &mdash; no warmth, no light, no food, no water.</p>

<p class="synopsis-text">The only hope left lies with that group, separated by vast distances. To have even the slightest chance, though, they&#x2019;ll need to make it to York. An entire country stands in the way, and the few individuals left populating it are unsavory at the very best.</p>

<p class="synopsis-text">The world lives and dies with their journey.</p>

<p class="body-text">Caracore is currently being written, with a goal of being finished in 2023. More information, including progress details, will be added here over time.</p>
