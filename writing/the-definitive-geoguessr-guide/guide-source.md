# The Complete Geoguessr Guide

## Basics

- Don't use the white arrows unless you need to move slowly! Click far away from you on the road to move farther with each step.

- Use the sun! If it's in the north, you're in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa. Near the equator, this becomes inaccurate, though, so be careful.

- Use the map! If you're not sure if a country uses a certain alphabet, or what its highway signs look like, or what the state abbreviations are, open the map and get all the information you can.

- Be smart about distances! You may not get a scale on the map, but if you see a sign that tells you city A is 50 km away and city B is 75 — and you can find both those cities on the map — then you should place your guess about half as far from A as A is from B.

- Work around the bugs! If you can't move forward by clicking the road, try using the white arrows a few times in case the route got encoded incorrectly. If a sign is blurred out, try moving in small increments to see if there's a point of view where it's not.

- Know which countries have Google Street View in the first place! Arabic is an incredibly widespread language, but when only it only appears in three countries in Geoguessr, it makes the guess much more managable.

## Identifying Languages

### Spanish

Alphabet: Latin

Found in: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, Venezuela

Identifying: Spanish is common enough that its appearance needs to be memorized, but a few defining characteristics are the ñ character and the word *y* (meaning *and*).

Example passage: Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos. Están dotados de razón y conciencia y deben actuar los unos con los otros con espíritu de hermandad.



### Portuguese

Alphabet: Latin

Found in: Brazil, Portugal

Identifying: Portuguese is visually very similar to Spanish (compare the two example passages), but it can be distinguished by the lack of the ñ character and the presence of tildes above vowels, the ç character, and (somewhat rarely) hats.

Example passage: Todos os seres humanos nascem livres e iguais em dignidade e direitos.  Eles são dotados de razão e consciência e devem agir uns com os outros com espírito de fraternidade.



### French

Alphabet: Latin

Found in: Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Senegal, Switzerland

Identifying: French can be distinguished by its copious use of accents and hats, as well as the occasional apostrophe inside words and ç character.

Example passage: Tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits. Ils sont dotés de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternité.



## Identifying Countries

### Canada

Languages: English and French

Top-level domain: .ca

Driving side: right

Flag: 

Highways: there are the two Trans-Canada highways and everything else.

- The Trans-Canada highways span the entire country east-west, and are marked by a maple leaf with the number 1 or 16 [pic].

- The provincial highways are all marked distinctively, and usually have the name of the province somewhere on the highway sign. [pics]

Notes:

- If you see mostly French, you’re probably in Quebec. A classic clue for this is stop signs that say *Arrêt*.

- If you have a good grasp on the biomes of the northern US, that translates pretty well to southern Canada -- so rolling plains is more likely to be Saskatchewan than British Columbia.



### The US

Language: English

Top-level domain: none (in common use, at least)

Driving side: right

Flag: 

Highways: they come in three sizes. From largest to smallest, there are interstates, US highways, and state highways.

- Interstates are marked with a blue and red shield and typically span from one border to another. Even numbers run east-west and odd ones north-south. [pic]

- US highways are marked with a white crest and can cross state borders, but typically don’t travel as far overall as interstates. Again, even numbered highways run east-west and odd ones north-south. [pic]

- State highways are the smallest overall and are marked differently for each state. [pic]

Other notes:

- A mediterranean climate typically indicates western California, while mountainous forest usually means western Oregon and Washington or northern Idaho. Outside of those regions, desert indicates roughly the left-most third of the country, plains the middle third, and temperate forest the right-most one. [pics]

- Look for signs in miles per hour (typically written without mph) and green-and-white highway signs [pic].

- Since the US was one of the first countries added to Google Street View, it’s common to find very blurry locations. If you see one, it’s probably either the US or Australia. [pic]



### Mexico

Language: Spanish

Top-level domain: .mx

Driving side: right

Flag: 

Highways:

- Federal ones are marked with a shield that says *Mexico*, and start their numbering in the northwest. As with the US, even numbered highways run east-west and odd ones north-south. [pic]

- State highways have a design with more straight lines and contain the abbrevation of the state's name instead of *Mexico*. [pic]

Notes:

- Much of Mexico's geography is desert, but Baja stands out in that regard — if you see a particularly barren location, there's a good chance you're there. [pic]
