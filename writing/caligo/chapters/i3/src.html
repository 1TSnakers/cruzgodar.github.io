"Kate." Travis slowed his pace, breathing hard. "Slow down. We need to wait for them."

Kate reluctantly stopped and turned around to face him. "Do you know what's going to happen in there? They're gonna get caught. Again. They'll be lucky if they're not killed. Right now, they're being locked back up, and there's not a chance in hell that we can get them out by ourselves. You understand that, right? If we couldn't do it with Melissa, we're not doing it without her."

Travis nodded vaguely, shivering and looking up at the cold dark buildings surrounding them. These outskirts were a place he wanted to leave as soon as he possibly could. And Kate was probably right. But still...

She must have seen the hesitation on what little of his face was showing. "Look." She drew the ballistic with such delicacy it could have been a poisoned blade. "Look at this. This is what we were here for." She gave it a couple flicks, clearly unused to handling such a weapon, but eventually the chamber of the pistol popped open and the cartridge fell into her hands. In the faint starlight, Travis could barely make out the dull gleam of four bullets. The weapon hadn't been hard to get --- Kate had waited in the shadows of the bottom stairwell once again and slipped it out of a guard's holster as he ran up.

"If we go back now, we're not going to see them. They're not coming out of that building. We're just going to wait and wait and eventually have to go back in, and then we're going to be right back where we started off, but without anyone coming for us."

Travis stared at her. "You *want* to leave them."

"No, I *want* to get back safely," Kate snapped. "We've got twenty miles to walk and no supplies without our packs. Once we give Vogel the gun and regroup, *then* we can talk about coming back out here. After the final strike, when we have the forces to spare."

"And when's that supposed to be? In a month?"

"If Charlie made it that long, so can the rest of them."

Travis ground his teeth. What burned the most was how right she was, for all the wrong reasons.

He swallowed with difficulty. "Fine."

The general drummed her fingers on the desk. They were the only part of her that moved --- the only thing moving at all in the room so white it shone. When she stared for long enough, she could see the walls melting away into glass, and the rock without into thin air.

She'd have no choice but to reevaluate before long. A day, maybe, or two. She still had six left, but she could only go so long before she'd have to accept that the mission wasn't coming back. If that happened, at least Amelia would be taken care of. But what then? Send a bigger group, of course, but without surprise on her side, it would have to be massive. Parading through the streets like a full-blown army --- no, that wouldn't do. She'd have to turn to contracting the work out, and even the thought made her lip curl.

A knock sounded on her door, and she glanced up, her thoughts scattered. "Come in."

One of the majors entered, her hair kept in a tight bun, her uniform uncomfortable, and her face unfeeling. Vogel had no intention of keeping up any of those habits when she sat at the top of the Watchtower. "We found the group from the prison, ma'am. Picked them up in the sewer."

"And?"

The major hesitated. "The mission was a success, but there were losses."

It took effort, but Vogel forced herself to ask about the second part first.

"Sergeant Burr is dead. Ballistic wound to the head."

That was the one who wanted her underlings to call her by her first name --- Marissa, wasn't it? The Resistance would probably be better off without her.

"Is that all?"

"And the privates were captured. Two of them escaped, but one is still imprisoned."

"It's Amelia, isn't it."

"I --- yes, ma'am, I believe that's her first name---"

"A tragic loss. Tell me, how did they get out?"

"Strangely enough, ma'am, it was the boy who brought us the prison documents in the first place. Richard Parkington's son."

"Of course it was." She rubbed a hand across her face --- this job never got any simpler. "Very well. Detain the two privates --- I fear that boy may have had a corrupting influence. Find a secure cell." The major on the other side of the door didn't even make a sound of surprise or doubt, and she had to commend her for that. "You said the mission was a success?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Good. Then bring me the gun."

"I have it here with me."

She gave the go-ahead, and the major stepped into the room, unmarked white package in hand. She handed it over, waited for her superior to immediately dismiss her, and closed the door behind her on the way out.

Vogel opened the package and handled the cold metal delicately, unchecked ambition coursing through her. Tabitha Emerson's reign was coming to an end, and with the strength she held in her hands, it would be with no whimper.
