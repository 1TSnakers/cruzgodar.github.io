		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				A few of the other thirty-something recruits were still yawning, unused to the uncivilized hour of six-thirty.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia wasn&#x2019;t.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The pushups were the constant, punctuating the other, stranger exercises. They came fast and brutal, and with so little time to rest before they started, the sets of forty were accompanied by thuds across the room as newer recruits failed to keep themselves off the floor.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia&#x2019;s muscles didn&#x2019;t give out much anymore. Every day she grew just a little bit stronger, but it was barely enough to keep up with Melissa&#x2019;s ever-increasing pace.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The Resistance was nearly three thousand strong, or so she&#x2019;d heard &mdash; never all in one place, lest they be ambushed, but split into a hundred regiments that cycled in and out of the massive cavern they were based in. Amelia had been placed into her regiment at random, as far as she could tell, chosen only because it had fewer members than average. Her drill sergeant, if gruff, was surprisingly kind &mdash; Amelia had expected someone hardened and mean, but Melissa asked them to call her by her first name, and even as she pushed them out of their comfort zones and firmly into agony, she was shouting encouragement.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Their first and only break came at ten-thirty, four hours after the day had begun. &#x201C;Be back here at eleven!&#x201D; Melissa shouted. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be late!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia traipsed with the rest out of the stone-walled room and into a wide corridor, flooded with nine other regiments&#x2019; worth of recruits following the path to the mess hall. Even if it was just a fraction of the whole organization&#x2019;s strength, three hundred people was still huge. They were old and young, but mostly young. Rich and poor, but mostly poor. Strong and weak, and plenty of both.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				As they emerged from the corridor, the ceiling dropped away above them, revealing the vaulting palace that was the common area. It was an enormous cave &mdash; nearly a hundred feet at its highest point, studded with lights, and streaked with veins of stones and minerals.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The floor always drew more attention than the ceiling, though. Grass grew everywhere, lush and tall, and trees of all kinds dotted the gently sloping ground, half of which Amelia had never seen before. It was a wild larger than a city block, larger than Stonewall park, a preserve hidden away within the city.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The mess hall was a less grand affair, little more than enough cheap tables and chairs to sit everyone. Amelia ate by herself &mdash; she didn&#x2019;t want to make any friends, and she didn&#x2019;t think she could, either.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The food was objectively terrible, not much more than variously colored gruel. Still, for most in the room, a meal was a meal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The time passed quickly for the people lost in excited conversation, but Amelia, lost only in her own thoughts, felt every minute drip by. When a girl sat down across from her, it took a moment before she processed that she was being talked at.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hello? I said&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia cleared her throat and focused. &#x201C;Sorry. Hi.&#x201D; Her mind was slower than she would have liked. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re in my regiment, yeah?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Unfortunately.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia squinted at her. &#x201C;Unfortunately.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You need to relax in there. You think Melissa&#x2019;s about to trust someone that excitable with anything important? You&#x2019;ll be stuck with guard duty and weapon upkeep.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Yeah, the drill sergeant is really gonna hate me for trying so hard.&#x201D; She went back to her meal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen that staff you keep here. I know who you took it from.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia brought her gaze back up. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t take it from anybody.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;He would never have given it away. He wouldn&#x2019;t tell me why he didn&#x2019;t have it with him, but I know he would never have given it to anyone.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Wait, were you <em>there?</em> What happened to him? What happened when&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You know what happened.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia&#x2019;s eyes were burning a little, but she blinked it away. &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The girl gave her a suspicious look, but eventually spoke. &#x201C;His liaison. I found the best person for the job and kept him honest.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You did a terrible job, then. He&#x2019;s not even a chemist.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I did a great job. You make me want to hurl even now.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia shook her head. &#x201C;What was the <em>point</em> of it? You gave up Charlie to make the whole city smell like rotten meat. Just to send a message?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;The <em>center</em> of the city. Don&#x2019;t act like you don&#x2019;t understand. The less hospitable the environment, the weaker its inhabitants.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia stared at her blankly. &#x201C;And was it worth it?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She got a blank stare back. &#x201C;Of <em>course</em> it&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Kate!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hey <em>Kate!</em>&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The shouts echoed even in the low-ceilinged room, and the girl turned to see a handful of people walking toward her, grinning. She got up to greet them, turning back to Amelia for just a moment. &#x201C;Put that staff back where you found it. It&#x2019;s not yours.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia finished her meal in silence. Her tray went on the stack outside the kitchens, and she left the mess hall ten minutes early, wandering back into the green of the atrium. She wound down a path that seemed in no hurry to get her where she was going, and that was more than fine.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She took a branch off the trail after a while, heading up the slope, and the rock ceiling closed back in around her. Further up the trail were the barracks &mdash; accommodations for nearly thirty people, to be used only in an emergency. Near it, an armory of hundreds upon thousands of weapons that had been donated and scrounged up from all across and outside of the city. Beyond that, an exit, hidden in an abandoned butcher shop.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The green disappeared from view as she moved further into the rock, and before long, little lines and circles began to gather on the walls. Amelia ran a hand along them without thinking much about it, but she never felt a thing. That had troubled her for days when she&#x2019;d first noticed &mdash; all of the intricate little patterns were seemingly holograms with no projector in sight &mdash; but she&#x2019;d had no choice to accept it like the other recruits as a part of the wonder.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Her path eventually led her to a row of wrought iron lockers. As with the barracks, there weren&#x2019;t nearly enough for everyone, but most never needed a locker and never used one.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia did both, though, and she found her number now, opening the combination lock and swinging the door wide. A long, mottled staff leaned against the side, nearly as tall as her. She pulled it out and left the locker open &mdash; it wasn&#x2019;t going back in.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Back down the hall, into the atrium, and toward the training rooms. Amelia pushed open the door to find Melissa leaning against a wall, lost in thought.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The drill sergeant heard the door open and looked at Amelia, expression flat but not unkind. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Her demeanor still threw Amelia off a little, but she ignored it and held out the staff. &#x201C;I want to learn how to use this.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Melissa looked at it for a few moments. &#x201C;Staves can be pretty hard to learn,&#x201D; she said at length.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I know. I&#x2019;ll work hard at it.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t doubt it. I do doubt that I would make a good teacher, though. They don&#x2019;t agree with me.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The door opened softly behind Amelia, and she knew her chance had passed. She nodded reluctantly and turned to see Kate standing six inches from her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Gonna rub salt in the wound?&#x201D; Amelia asked. What do you have against me?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The rest of the recruits in the division were filing in. Amelia just shook her head and sat down at her spot on the floor.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You want to learn how to use that?&#x201D; Kate murmured, taking a seat next to her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia eyed her skeptically and nodded.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Tough shit.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Four more hours of training, though for what, Amelia still didn&#x2019;t know. She could barely move by the end, her arms and legs jelly, and it was all she could do to collect her paycheck and leave. She had a weekly stipend, barely enough to cover a room and food for one person, but it was almost as much as she had made at Ann&#x2019;s Pastries, and though that wasn&#x2019;t saying much, it meant she could still tell Lucas she had a job. She had to throw in a little of her savings every week, but that was fine by her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She left as soon as it was over, ignoring Kate and Melissa alike. The staff came with her for once, up onto the roof of the apartment. Lucas had tried to find another, but on such short notice, he&#x2019;d met with little success. Amelia still kept vigilant when she could, watching for any more hitmen, inside her home or out. None came, and she was beginning to believe they wouldn&#x2019;t. What that meant, she couldn&#x2019;t begin to guess.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				No one was home yet, so retiring to the roof invited no criticism. She found a tiny nook her staff fit in and nestled it there &mdash; she&#x2019;d get to it later.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Even after eight hours of training, Amelia still had work to do. She hadn&#x2019;t missed a day since Charlie had been taken, and she didn&#x2019;t intend to. So she dragged herself to her feet and fought through a hundred squats and situps and pushups, each set becoming shorter and shorter. She collapsed when it was over, lying on the warm gravel and gulping air. It was good to be so exhausted she couldn&#x2019;t think straight &mdash; straight thought had begun to hurt.
