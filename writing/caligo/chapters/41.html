				It had finally arrived. The sky was a deep, saturated red, heralding the sun.

				Outliers were everywhere, so diluted by the crowd that it was hopeless to try to capture them. The police didn&#x2019;t &mdash; they concentrated their efforts instead on securing the gate and the Watchtower, and they were effective at both. Though cold air still flowed in freely from the ravaged gate, the area both in and around the border was thick with guards &mdash; ten times what had been stationed there before, if not more. There was a similarly solid garrison and surrounding the Watchtower, but while the area outside the gate was empty and the police undisturbed, the Watchtower force found themselves surrounded on all sides by a crowd made increasingly of outliers, as one-by-one, their paths brought them to the city&#x2019;s center.

			<p class="body-text">
				Along the way, they took what they needed. Weapons, food, and occasionally clothing were taken from hundreds of locations spread out across the city &mdash; sometimes by force, but more often given willingly. The Resistance was more than its members, and that was clearer than ever. When those first few outliers began to gather around the Watchtower, joined by hundreds of citizens, they were as armed and ready for battle as the police.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

				And still, not a shot was fired.

				The Resistance had finished packing. Every member that had kept possessions in the cave now had them on their backs, and everyone, regardless of age or rank or skill, had something to fight with. Three thousand armed forces hadn&#x2019;t depleted the armory, even with some veterans carrying two weapons. They ranged from rubiguns to polearms, crossbows to daggers, and with few exceptions, everyone who carried something knew how to use it.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				No one talked about why they were leaving nothing behind, but everyone understood &mdash; if they failed, there was no coming back. Most chose not to think too much about that, though, preferring the nebulous feeling of rebellion that surged through every one of them.

		</div>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Every one, including Charlie. It was hard not to feel the urgency as his own as he moved through the darkness. It was an uncomfortable darkness and an uncomfortable silence, thick with the fear of a guard coming down without a light and bumping into him. But he made it to the top of the tunnel without incident and didn&#x2019;t lose his balance when he stopped, even as the world according to the robots pitched forward.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie turned his head slowly, to mitigate nausea, and sized up the room. It was well guarded. Past a physical map of the city were four guards &mdash; two behind the map and two guarding the tunnel leading to Vogel&#x2019;s office. He&#x2019;d have to be careful.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He slipped out of the doorway and into the room without the first two guards noticing a thing, then crouched against the wall opposite the tunnel to Vogel&#x2019;s office. After a moment&#x2019;s thought, he lifted a foot up and stomped it down, then quickly moved away. That set the guards talking about what the noise could have been, and when Charlie stomped his foot again, one of the guards by the door moved to look.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				It was all the window Charlie needed. He slipped around and into the tunnel, padding silently down to the looming white door, and pressed up against the wall next to it to wait.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				It was a long wait, and an anxious one. The guards didn&#x2019;t talk any further, and Charlie&#x2019;s feet kept falling asleep. But after nearly half an hour, the door down the tunnel opened and Vogel strode out, intense and purposeful.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie&#x2019;s heart descended gradually from his throat when he realized the door hadn&#x2019;t actually hit his nose, and instead had only come within an inch. He was so preoccupied that he almost forgot to grab the door until it was nearly closed, and when he was finally inside the general&#x2019;s office, he let out a long sigh and a short laugh, amazed it had all worked.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And he heard her, addressing the eager masses with her grit and gritty voice, and though he couldn&#x2019;t see her, Charlie knew she was standing tall and imposing and captivating, and though he only heard bits and pieces, he knew the speech would be perfect.

				She took paths that were familiar, pushing through the exploding streets with the brutality of a city native. Unintentionally, she found herself passing Ann&#x2019;s Pastries, long since closed down and seemingly looted.

				The people were whipped into a frenzy. Amelia caught snippets of their conversations as she forced her way toward the center. Most of the citizens had no idea what was going on, just that something big was happening around the Watchtower. Amelia heard the words <em>outliers</em> and <em>Resistance</em>, but neither often. Everyone she heard saying them, though, was heading in the other direction, getting away from the event as fast as they could. Amelia expected that was the smart choice.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Almost everyone was going the same way as her, though &mdash; pushing and shoving their way toward the city&#x2019;s center. They moved faster and faster as they drew closer, and eventually Amelia stopped pushing and had to worry about being trampled instead.

				Taking familiar turns on instinct, even when taking turns at all was a challenge in itself, she saw an alley and darted down it, breaking free of the human river. For just a moment, she thought she hadn&#x2019;t remembered what the place looked like, but then she emerged into a familiar courtyard, complete with a dry fountain and a bundle of tarps thrown over a cellar door, and she knew she&#x2019;d found it.
