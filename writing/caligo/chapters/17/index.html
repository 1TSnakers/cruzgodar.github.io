	Amelia rose before dawn, even though it was a Saturday &mdash; it was easier and easier these days to blink the sandpaper out of her eyes without even rubbing them and step softly out of bed, no alarm necessary. It was as dark and featureless in the apartment as an old gravestone, and Amelia tiptoed out, careful not to wake either of her brothers.
	
	Up to the roof, first. She couldn&#x2019;t make breakfast without disturbing Lucas and Nate, and nothing was open so early, so she wouldn&#x2019;t be getting anything from a store, legally or not. But she wasn&#x2019;t going to be busy for long, and maybe she&#x2019;d treat herself to a nicer meal than usual when she was free later that morning. The jug on the roof was idling around a hundred and eighty thousand &mdash; plenty to spare.
	
	Amelia pushed herself up onto a garbage can as delicately as she could and climbed up the rain gutter with a series of familiar footholds. That was something else that had become easier &mdash; just a few months ago, she&#x2019;d struggled to get to the top without slipping from fatigue, but now she bounded up like a panther and hoisted herself over the edge. She&#x2019;d never met whoever lived in the third-floor apartment, and by now she needed to keep it that way.
	
	She was so focused on her feet that she barely avoided walking into the other figure on the roof, visible only as a silhouette against the distant glow.
	
	Amelia sucked in just one sharp breath before she realized who it was. There wasn&#x2019;t any hiding that she was up there, so after a few moments&#x2019; hesitation, she just sat a dozen feet away from him, letting her legs dangle over the edge. He kept a careful distance from it.
	
	After a minute or two of silence, Amelia had begun to grow a little antsy. She really didn&#x2019;t have time for this.
	
	But still. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201D; It really was &mdash; the pale neon of the city, backlighting thousands of dark buildings, was a peaceful sight. The air was crisp and cool, and if she hadn&#x2019;t had a meeting to attend, she would have stayed there for a while.
	
	She&#x2019;d tried to make her words sincere, and even still they sounded curt. These days that happened more and more, toward Lucas especially, and she couldn&#x2019;t help but feel sabotaged by some deeper part of her that resented everyone, those closest to her more than most.
	
	&#x201C;It is.&#x201D; Lucas sounded tired, and Amelia wondered if he&#x2019;d even slept. He was quiet for long enough that she almost spoke up again, but eventually he continued. &#x201C;How come you&#x2019;re up here?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;How come you are?&#x201D;
	
	Lucas sighed and ran a hand over his thinning hair. &#x201C;I was waiting for you,&#x201D; he said, his tone now tending toward defeat. Amelia didn&#x2019;t have a response to that, so they fell into silence for another stretch.
	
	Â Eventually: &#x201C;You know I&#x2019;m just trying to look out for you.&#x201D; A familiar edge began to creep into his voice, and he seemed to catch it, sighing. He rubbed his face with his hands, and Amelia realized she could see him, barely, in the uncertain light. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t help but worry. I know that&#x2019;s hard for you to...&#x201D; He trailed off, still staring out. &#x201C;I know it&#x2019;s easier not to be here sometimes.&#x201D;
	
	She knew he cared about her. That never went away, just turned against him. Trying to guide was being controlling. Providing was being gone constantly. Strong and stoic was emotionally distant. None was true in either extreme, but it was a rare thing to be able to step back and see that.
	
	But what was she supposed to do? She couldn&#x2019;t leave the Resistance. Even if they let her, she&#x2019;d be stuck without a job once again. Without a purpose, her mind offered, but it was a little too subconscious for her to notice. She couldn&#x2019;t do nothing about Tabitha, or Charlie. His death &mdash; by now the last bits of hope that he was coming back had evaporated &mdash; had been the spark, but Amelia knew she&#x2019;d been a pile of kindling long before then. No, she couldn&#x2019;t leave. Not from this.
	
	So she just nodded in response to Lucas. Any more would have been a lie, any less an insult.
	
	She felt the resentment creeping back.
	
	The eastern sky was a deep crimson now, and Amelia knew her time was up. She said a quick and probably unsatisfactory goodbye to Lucas and stood up, stepping over the rooftop back to the rain gutter. She couldn&#x2019;t get to her jug while he was watching &mdash; she wasn&#x2019;t about to risk him realizing he could accelerate the York fund &mdash; but that was fine. There were worse things than skipping breakfast.
	
	Amelia took a last look at her brother before climbing down. He was only just visible in the dawn light, and the thought flashed unbidden across her mind that his beard could have been gray, even white, and she wouldn&#x2019;t have seen.

	Her name was General Vogel, but her voice was nothing like birdsong, a gritty, gravelly rust that seemed incapable of calm.
	
	Amelia stood among a crowd of no more than a hundred &mdash; the strongest of the recruits, apparently. She felt a dull pride.
	
	Kate was there, too, along with someone else from their regiment that Kate talked to more than any other, even if that was hardly saying anything. Amelia was fairly sure his name was Travis. His head was shaved and his muscles were small weapons. He was easily stronger than either Amelia or Kate, but he was barely a week into the program, and his form needed work. Still &mdash; he was here. Amelia made a note to talk to him later.
	
	A hush fell suddenly over the crowd, and she turned to the stage to see the leader of the Resistance emerge, flanked by the five majors, onto a jut of rock in the wall ten feet above the ground. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t get a great look at her from so far away &mdash; Melissa had chosen to be near the back of the crowd &mdash; but the main features matched what she&#x2019;d heard.
	
	Short, straight, graying blonde hair, cropped just below the ears. Skin grave-pale from staying out of the sun. Eyes piercing green, the only youthful part of her face. The rest was a mess of wrinkles, marking too many years lived in too short a time. The rumors varied about her exact age, but most seemed to agree it was around forty.
	
	Vogel waited for the crowd to quiet completely before speaking. Her voice needed no megaphone &mdash; it carried to the ends of the massive chamber easily.
	
	&#x201C;Sergeants,&#x201D; she said, and about thirty of them, Melissa included, snapped off salutes. Everyone Amelia had talked to agreed on one thing at least &mdash; Vogel&#x2019;s title of general was genuine. She&#x2019;d served in the army right up until Umbra, climbing and climbing until she sat near its head. And she was still a stickler for protocol. No one seemed to know how she&#x2019;d ended up in Los Angeles, but she had founded the Resistance, and had been reelected every one of the next six years. Almost no one knew of her outside the cave walls, but she was wildly popular within, if seldom seen. This appearance was all the more special for it.
	
	&#x201C;Privates.&#x201D; Another group, maybe twice as large, saluted. Amelia was among them, and her pride doubled. <em>This</em> was why she was here. Because it felt good to be a part of something she believed in. She waited, restraining her excitement, for Vogel to speak.
	
	And she did. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the best we have,&#x201D; she rasped. &#x201C;Understand that. Believe it. Don&#x2019;t get caught up in it. You&#x2019;re the best we have, but you could always be better.&#x201D; She held their attention like food to a dog.
	
	&#x201C;We are at the brink of a turning point. With a final set of supply missions, we will be prepared to strike at the heart of the government. Just a handful of months, and we will be ready.&#x201D;
	
	Her gaze swept across them. &#x201C;Your sergeant will tell you the specifics of your objectives. You must not fail. The future of your city, of your world, is at stake. Don&#x2019;t disappoint us.&#x201D;
	
	And with that, the general turned and stepped back through the door, five majors following quietly behind.

	Amelia had expected something... more. Longer, maybe, or more forceful. She knew she should be glad she had been chosen in the first place, but that didn&#x2019;t even seem all that hard &mdash; she and Kate and Travis were the best in Melissa&#x2019;s regiment, and that was that.
	
	The sergeants had dispersed immediately, funneling off down hallways their rank let them access. The recruits were left to idle in the common area, many lounging under the trees that spread gently up the slope. Amelia decided they had the right idea and laid down herself, staring up at the yawning ceiling. The trees cast no shade &mdash; the array of fluorescent lights above illuminated every angle. She watched them like stars.
	
	Then one of the stars flickered, catching her attention. Then another, and then ten more, all in a patch in the center of the dome. They flipped between light and dark faster than she could process before finally staying bright once again.
	
	And then they shut off completely.
	
	Amelia glanced around. A few others had seen the sudden stain in the light, but most either didn&#x2019;t notice or didn&#x2019;t care. After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, she decided Melissa ought to know about it. She stood up and left the other recruits, wandering down the hallway, until she reached her regiment&#x2019;s door.
	
	And stopped short, because there was a voice she didn&#x2019;t recognize speaking inside.
	
	Gingerly, she backed up, leaned back nonchalantly against the wall next to the door, and listened.
	
	&#x201C;...not an easy solution. If there were, we&#x2019;d have already gotten it.&#x201D; That was a woman&#x2019;s voice, one Amelia didn&#x2019;t recognize.
	
	&#x201C;There&#x2019;s really none under the dome?&#x201D; Melissa. Both of them were talking fervently, in tones so hushed Amelia struggled to understand.
	
	&#x201C;None. Tabby&#x2019;s been good at that, if nothing else. Hell, you can&#x2019;t go five feet without hearing they&#x2019;ll kill you if you&#x2019;ve got one.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Well, I think you&#x2019;ve come to the wrong person. The next thing I would try is getting one from Vegas, but...&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Yeah, there are a few problems with that, but we&#x2019;ve already sent a dozen separate envoys. One should be back in time, if any of them make it.&#x201D;
	
	There was a lengthy silence, and then Melissa continued. &#x201C;I take it Vogel doesn&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re talking to me.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;If you get what we need, she won&#x2019;t need to. And you&#x2019;ll be rewarded plenty.&#x201D;
	
	No one spoke, and the conversation seemed to be over. With a quick motion, well practiced from listening at kitchen doors to sneak into, Amelia spun and stepped back ten feet in three paces, then smoothly reversed her momentum, striding forward just as the door opened. The major &mdash; she&#x2019;d been right &mdash; saw only a recruit walking down the hall, nowhere near close enough to eavesdrop. Amelia kept her eyes down as they passed one another, and then the major was past, and she was in front of her training room. She stepped inside to see Melissa sitting on the wood-paneled floor, staring at the wall. Lost in thought. She gave Amelia a glance when she walked in before seeming to catch herself and standing up, smiling thinly. &#x201C;Enjoy the speech?&#x201D;
	
	Amelia smiled and nodded, but maybe she didn&#x2019;t do enough of either, because Melissa squinted at her and frowned. &#x201C;You sure about that?&#x201D;
	
	Well, if she asked. &#x201C;I guess I expected a little more.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;That&#x2019;s understandable. But the general is a busy woman &mdash; she has to plan missions and attacks and keep all of us safe, and she doesn&#x2019;t have that much time to give speeches. It doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re unimportant.&#x201D;
	
	Amelia knew the words were true on some level, but still... &#x201C;Does it? It wasn&#x2019;t that hard to get picked &mdash; like, Travis got in, and he&#x2019;s only been here for a week.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Amelia &mdash; no, listen.&#x201D; Melissa&#x2019;s expression hardened. &#x201C;Kate recruited Travis personally, but that&#x2019;s beside the point. Did you see how many sergeants there were at the speech?&#x201D;
	
	Amelia shook her head, already regretting saying a thing.
	
	&#x201C;Twenty-five. Twenty-five supply parties. I had to convince Major Gomez I had a regiment capable enough to be considered, and <em>then</em> I had to fight tooth and nail for you. Travis has Kate to vouch for him, and she&#x2019;s been here years. You have no one. The person who&#x2019;s supposed to convince us you&#x2019;re not a traitor, not a spy, not going to kill us the moment we&#x2019;re all away from here? He&#x2019;s long gone, and wasn&#x2019;t ever a full member to begin with. He told us about you, sure, but it was still really damn hard to get you on this mission. But I wanted you here, because <em>I</em> think you&#x2019;re not going to backstab us. <em>I</em> think you&#x2019;re not going to sell us out. But <em>I</em> don&#x2019;t know you that well. So, no, this isn&#x2019;t something that you should have expected. This is your chance to prove yourself. To show us that you&#x2019;re working with the government or anyone else. Alright?&#x201D;
	
	Amelia swallowed and nodded, knowing she ought to apologize. Maybe not just to Melissa. She began to open her mouth, but the door beat her to it, swinging wide and admitting Kate and Travis, chatting.
	
	Melissa&#x2019;s attention took flight like a startled bird, landing close by. &#x201C;Good,&#x201D; she told them. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re here.&#x201D; She squinted briefly at Kate, who had said more words to Travis in the last minute than she ever had to Amelia, but then she shook her head and began to speak.
	
	&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not waste time &mdash; our job is to get batteries. Big ones, the kind we can get a serious amount of power from.&#x201D; She paused. &#x201C;And there aren&#x2019;t enough in one place under the dome. We don&#x2019;t want to risk angering any more people than we have to, anyway.
	
	&#x201C;So. We&#x2019;re going outside.&#x201D;
	
	Travis made a surprised noise, and Amelia&#x2019;s eyes widened despite herself. Kate was motionless.
	
	Melissa continued. &#x201C;I know it might not be possible for all of you, but I&#x2019;d recommend getting your own clothes if you can. They&#x2019;ll fit you better, and we don&#x2019;t have all that many sets available here. Especially if there might be other groups going outside.&#x201D;
	
	Maybe it was a good thing she hadn&#x2019;t spent any money on breakfast, then.
	
	&#x201C;We leave tomorrow at nine. Meet here. Don&#x2019;t be late. Questions?&#x201D;
	
	Amelia was still trying to comprehend what they were doing, but apparently Kate wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201C;What are our primary targets?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Office buildings,&#x201D; Melissa replied, &#x201C;especially big and old ones. The top floors might not be looted and a few of the computers might have salvageable components. The generator room, too, if there is one.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;How long do we plan to be out?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Six hours, roughly. We&#x2019;ll provide supplies.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;How far?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Until we find something.&#x201D;
	
	Kate nodded. She snapped off a salute and left.
	
	Travis was next. &#x201C;Will we be safe?&#x201D; It was the question on Amelia&#x2019;s mind that she was too afraid to ask.
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201D; Melissa said, &#x201C;as long as we stay together and stay smart and keep our guards up. Most mistakes come from carelessness.&#x201D; She narrowed her eyes at him for the briefest of moments, sizing him up, then turned to Amelia. &#x201C;You alright?&#x201D;
	
	It was two questions, but she had the same answer to both. &#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I am.&#x201D; She even smiled a little, though she wasn&#x2019;t feeling like it.
	
	How could she feel like smiling when they were about to march into the darkness so complete it could swallow them whole? The cold so frigid it froze people solid? The cataclysm of a world that had killed her father?
	
	No, she didn&#x2019;t feel much like smiling.

	Her stomach was growling as she walked home &mdash; it was nearly eleven and she hadn&#x2019;t eaten a thing. Lucas was still there, reclining and reading something dry, but Nate had already left. Lucas didn&#x2019;t try to talk, and that was fine by her. She pulled out half a loaf of stale bread and an almost-empty jar of marmalade. Together, they almost looked like breakfast. She started to cut up the bread... and then there was a knock at the door. Amelia smiled a little without realizing it &mdash; there was only one person she could think of who would be at her doorstep on a Saturday morning. Perfect timing, too.
	
	And sure enough, when she opened the door, there was Ben, wearing a grimace disguised as a smile. She couldn&#x2019;t tell, grinning wide. Money be damned.
