				By now, Ben had stopped telling himself it was going to be his last time outside.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He was up to &mdash; what was it now, eight? Eight times sneaking out in less than three weeks. Mr. Lipcott never showed any disapproval, just assigned more reading to compensate for the lost lectures. And if Ben was a little guilty, he certainly didn&#x2019;t let it show.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He felt like an archaeologist, unearthing unknown cultural treasures &mdash; unknown to him, at least. Books, mostly, but also old remnants of technology &mdash; one of his favorites was an old metal flash drive with a port so obsolete he couldn&#x2019;t find any cables in the camera room that matched, not that there was a computer he could plug it into regardless. He even collected a few tools, though the blue pocketknife he had bought on his first trip was still his favorite.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben tried to be frugal, but he was burning through money. Books were frightfully expensive because paper was, because large trees weren&#x2019;t grown at all in the farmland and any small ones were fruit-bearing, never to be harvested. Most books for sale had been made pre-Umbra and were considered antiques, and the few made after, like the one account he&#x2019;d bought that first time out, were luxuries available to only the richest citizens.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And sure, he counted among those, but it was still money he barely had. Ben&#x2019;s parents had given him a hefty allowance long ago, and it seemed Richard had never bothered to cancel it. After half a dozen years, he had nearly a million dollars to his name.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Well. Less than a third of that, now.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He&#x2019;d taken a bicycle rickshaw out closer to the edge today, but when his stomach began to growl, Ben figured the books could wait and ducked into a pastry store. Nothing on the shelves looked anywhere near as good as what the Golden Crown&#x2019;s chef served, but he&#x2019;d long since stopped caring. He ordered an assortment of pastries and took a seat, giving the place another once-over. It was nearly empty &mdash; there was an older woman slumped on a table and a boy sitting on a stool looking out the window, and no one else. Ben took a window seat too, a few away from him.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The third time the boy sighed and looked forlornly out the window, Ben couldn&#x2019;t stop himself, setting down a donut and glancing over. &#x201C;Everything alright?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The kid looked at Ben, his expression a little confused and a little annoyed, and shrugged. &#x201C;I guess.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You guess?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. My siblings aren&#x2019;t really getting along right now.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; Ben had been taught to win arguments, not console people. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The boy shrugged again and didn&#x2019;t say anything. Eventually, though, he looked back at Ben. &#x201C;You look like you should be eating somewhere nicer than this.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben laughed a little. &#x201C;Maybe. I wanted to see what this kind of place was like.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The boy nodded. &#x201C;My sister works here,&#x201D; he said eventually.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Ben turned around to look at the counter, but the kid shook his head. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s not here right now.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben wasn&#x2019;t sure how to respond to that, but before he could think, the boy sat up straighter, held out his hand, and smiled thinly. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Nate.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The door burst open before Ben got the chance to introduce himself, filling the space with a clatter of bells and a frazzled-looking girl, her features strained and her brown hair wild. When her gaze fixed on Nate, she looked so relieved she seemed to deflate.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Any of the tension that had left Nate&#x2019;s face came right back at the sight of her, but he smiled so quickly that Ben wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d seen anything else.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hey, Nate,&#x201D; she breathed, trying to smile herself. &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s this?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I&#x2019;m Ben.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Ben, this is my sister Amelia.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He held out his hand to her. &#x201C;A pleasure.&#x201D; She squinted at him, and he continued. &#x201C;You work here?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia&#x2019;s eyes narrowed further, and she glanced at Nate. &#x201C;Telling him all about me, huh?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Nate said, any hint of a smile long gone. &#x201C;I was lying. Wasn&#x2019;t I?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia clenched her jaw. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. C&#x2019;mon, Nate.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you come with, Ben? I&#x2019;ll introduce you to the people outside our house.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;<em>What are you doing?</em>&#x201D; Amelia hissed.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Nate shrugged. &#x201C;Maybe I&#x2019;m just lying again.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben looked from one to the other and decided he wanted no part of whatever their relationship was. &#x201C;I think I should&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You&#x2019;re coming with.&#x201D; Nate got up and dragged Ben with him by the arm, leading them out of the store. Amelia stormed out behind them, and soon they were all marching forcefully through the streets.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				After a minute or two, Nate let go of Ben and moved ahead of them, leading the way through the crowd. Ben was stuck next to Amelia, and the only thing keeping him there was a sense of etiquette.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You quit your job?&#x201D; he asked eventually.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Go to hell.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Well, Nate seems nice, for what it&#x2019;s worth. If I can ask, what&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Can you please just leave? I&#x2019;m trying to argue with my brother &mdash; I don&#x2019;t need you to mediate.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben pursed his lips. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had training in diplomacy from Christina Sabel herself. I think I&#x2019;d be a more than capable mediator&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;What &mdash; what are you <em>talking</em> about? Who even are you?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I thought I introduced myself.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No, just...&#x201D; Amelia rubbed her face. &#x201C;Whatever. <em>Whatever.</em> I can&#x2019;t deal with this right now. Do whatever you want.&#x201D; She turned and followed Nate, now half a block away.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				They walked in silence. Ben didn&#x2019;t have the courage to speak up again &mdash; or the will to leave &mdash; and Amelia didn&#x2019;t so much as look at him.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Eventually, they reached the outskirts of town. The crowds had cleared out, and Nate stayed visible in front of them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201D; Ben murmured after a while. Nate was glancing down every alley and into every sewer grate he passed.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Her voice had lost its edge. &#x201C;Looking for a dog.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;But all the dogs were euthanized after&mdash;&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I know.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				A few moments passed, and Amelia exhaled through clenched teeth. &#x201C;I got fired a week ago.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben gave her a glance, but didn&#x2019;t press her, and eventually she spoke again.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I deserved it, too. I&#x2019;d been spending all my time learning martial arts. Man, look at me now. No more money, and I can barely roll.&#x201D; She looked at Ben and gave a small laugh, seeming surprised she&#x2019;d been talking out loud. She shook her head and fell silent again, and Ben followed suit.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Half an hour later, he was snapped from his thoughts when Amelia held an arm out in front of him and pushed him into an alley. Nate was already there, and Ben began to protest before seeing the two suited, sunglassed, earpieced men standing in front of a tiny corner apartment and putting the pieces together.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia&#x2019;s expression clouded, and she turned to Nate. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. I told Lucas we&#x2019;d meet in Stonewall park if they were still here.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				They made their way briskly through the city, passing skyscrapers and slums, until eventually, the ground began to slope upward, turning greener, and they passed a sign dubbing the place Stonewall park. There wasn&#x2019;t a stone or wall in sight, just a grassy hill scattered with trees that covered an entire city block.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				They reached the top, Ben panting, and Amelia glanced around before shaking her head. Apparently none of the dozen people there was Lucas. She led Nate over to a bench and they sunk down, exhausted.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben almost followed. It seemed like Amelia was warming up a little, and outside of Kate, he hadn&#x2019;t talked to someone his own age in years. But he knew he was supposed to be getting back soon, and that always took priority. According to his watch, it was&mdash;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Oh.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Oh, no.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He was supposed to be back <em>now.</em> Twenty minutes ago, in fact. And looking out from the hill, there was the Golden Crown, shining in the afternoon, towering over its competition. Three miles away, and out of his reach.

				The last ten steps were the hardest.

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				 The rest hadn&#x2019;t been easy &mdash; not at all &mdash; but walking home and walking in were two very different things indeed. He&#x2019;d come home by bicycle, stepping out in the back alley, but the door wouldn&#x2019;t open to his key when he tried it. Slowly, he dragged himself to the front entrance.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				In that final moment of freedom as he pulled open the glass doors, despite the consequences he knew were coming, he decided he would have done it all again in a heartbeat.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				A heartbeat later, he wasn&#x2019;t so sure.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Richard was in the entrance hall, sitting on one of the chairs intended for guests to wait and mingle. He was talking to two assistants, but the moment he saw Ben, he waved them away and stood up, buttoning his jacket. His face betrayed nothing. That carefully trimmed gray bread never seemed to grow whiter, and those wrinkles never seemed to multiply.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Where have you been?&#x201D; He sounded genuinely curious.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Outside,&#x201D; Ben said slowly, feeling dread coil up in his stomach. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to lie &mdash; it was going to be bad enough as it was.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Richard nodded. &#x201C;And of course you had a chaperone with you.&#x201D; His voice was even softer now.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Ben murmured. Richard hadn&#x2019;t allowed a chaperone in months, and even when he did, it was a fleeting trip, usually focused on an errand for himself.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Speak up!&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t even angry, just an order.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No,&#x201D; he said again, louder this time.

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Richard nodded curtly, approving his son&#x2019;s manners in spite of it all. &#x201C;Good.&#x201D; His voice dropped back to its usual register. &#x201C;Now, you had help.&#x201D; He inclined his head. &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I... yes.&#x201D; Ben almost managed to lie, almost resisted, but it was too hard &mdash; the consequences were too severe.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Who, then? Delvy?&#x201D; He looked at Ben with a questioning face.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The dread in Ben&#x2019;s stomach coiled tighter, rattling its tail. He was on thin ice.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He couldn&#x2019;t lie to his father. But he could act on instinct.

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;She... didn&#x2019;t want me to,&#x201D; he said, finding himself trying to tell a convincing story. &#x201C;She said&mdash;&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">

				And Ben knew he was doomed.

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;He always was too friendly with you.&#x201D; Richard sounded absentminded. &#x201C;I should have had him removed months ago. But I suppose it doesn&#x2019;t matter now.&#x201D; He turned his attention back to Ben and curled his lip just enough to be noticeable &mdash; a practiced gesture. &#x201C;Now, since you&#x2019;ve so clearly forgotten, let me remind you. You are <em>not to go outside alone!</em>&#x201D; He ended in a loud but controlled shout, and Ben flinched just a little, brushing against the uniforms of two doormen that had slid in behind him. They picked up his bag and the expensive book along with it.

				Ben lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling. Thoughts of books led to thoughts of history, and his mind lurched its way back to Mr. Lipcott. All of his thoughts were tied to the teacher like shackles, and they seemed to chain his body down as well.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

				It didn&#x2019;t get better as the hours passed and the sun lowered, just less sharp, and eventually he was able to hide the thoughts away &mdash; or maybe hide himself from them. He got up and paced around his room, then, finding himself staring out the window. It faced south, and in the dying light, he thought he could see the tiny bit of green that was Stonewall park far, far in the distance.

				On the right side of his view was the Watchtower, its tinted glass preventing him from seeing inside at all. It sparkled like some great ice crystal, as if it were about to melt.

				Ice led to the cold, and the cold to night, and eventually Ben returned to a familiar daydream about the knowledge that was surely hidden outside. He imagined stepping into the brisk night air, seeing the stars for what they really were, pulling a massive book off an abandoned, dusty shelf and understanding every word. He let the idea spread until it was almost more real than the room around him, turning it over in his mind like a pebble long since worn smooth by restless hands.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He paced and paced, looking for something to do. He cleaned his room, organizing what few belongings were out of their proper places and pulling random books off the shelves and failing to read a single page.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Sleep took him much later, when the silence became too loud to ignore. His mind saw fit to dream of class with Mr. Lipcott &mdash; no strange occurrences, no omens, just a plain, almost boring dream of sitting at a desk, reading and answering questions.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				When he woke suddenly, Ben grimaced. It took him a few moments to figure out what had woken him in the first place &mdash; a quiet voice coming from his wall. Ben pushed himself, glancing at the clock &mdash; it was nearly two in the morning, there was a voice in the wall, and yet he was sure he wasn&#x2019;t dreaming. Still bleary-eyed, he padded over to the wall and pressed his ear up against it.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;...it doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201D; Richard was saying. &#x201C;You still shouldn&#x2019;t call on this line.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;What other line is there?&#x201D; The other voice was a man&#x2019;s, scratchy and staticky.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				There was silence for a moment, and then: &#x201C;Well?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Well what?&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;It is still going to happen?&#x201D; Richard growled. Ben was unused to hearing him agitated.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; the other man replied. &#x201C;Tomorrow afternoon.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Then why did you call?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Because we have a deal. You think I want to talk to you? I&#x2019;d rather be out with the rest of us. Lord knows they want me there.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Richard grunted. &#x201C;So what happens afterward?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;God, has no one been talking to you? The restructure of the power grid will start in a few weeks. Long enough that no one gets suspicious. That good enough?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Richard muttered. &#x201C;Very well.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The line went silent, and Ben sat back in confusion, his thoughts of Mr. Lipcott gone. What had taken its place spiraled around and around, and eventually, he had to pin one thing down at a time and figure it out.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The man. That had to come first. He was important, had to be &mdash; no one but the most elite could talk on a phone line that connected to the mayor and Richard. Ben could count on two hands the people he knew who could fit the role, but that voice wasn&#x2019;t familiar. At all.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Then there was whatever was going to happen the next day. Ben looked out the window and saw a city cloaked in darkness like spiderwebs, but nothing out of the ordinary.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And the power grid, of all things! That affected Kate somehow. Sure, it was only done every few years, but it only took a month or so, and its purpose was just to remove any illicit draw of energy &mdash; something no citizen had reason to fear, least of all Kate.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He lay down on his bed once more, though his thoughts had changed wildly. The scratchy-voiced man and the mysterious event, the power grid restructure and Kate, Amelia and Mr. Lipcott &mdash; they all fought for control of his mind, battling back and forth. For the next hour, guilt and fear and curiosity and regret ran amok, and it was with relief that Ben finally sunk into a dreamless sleep.
