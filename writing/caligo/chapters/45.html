				Charlie woke very suddenly from a nightmare he couldn&#x2019;t remember, jolting up. He could barely see.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The directionless adrenaline ebbed before long, and he got up slowly and felt his way around a five-foot cube, barely big enough for him to lie down diagonally and much too short to stand up straight.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He&#x2019;d failed. The thought hit hard, and he sat down again, rubbing his face and groaning. Either Heather had the gun now or she&#x2019;d left it for Vogel, and there was no telling what either situation would bring.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie heard a familiar voice. No, two. Arguing with one another. He shook his head and winced, trying to remember.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; he called after a few moments, interrupting them. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m getting déjà vu. Can we do less arguing and more escaping?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Yeah, how about it, Kate? What if we actually tried to get out of here?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Quiet. It&#x2019;s a good thing Charlie&#x2019;s here, you know. He can tell you how stupid you&#x2019;re being.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you two just the model couple.&#x201D; He snorted. &#x201C;What seems to be the problem?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Travis thinks the Resistance is <em>evil.</em>&#x201D; Charlie could hear the sneer in her voice. &#x201C;That just &#x2019;cause Vogel put us here, she doesn&#x2019;t care about any of the members.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Yeah!&#x201D; Travis barked a laugh. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s exactly what I think. What kind of a leader locks up her subjects, Kate?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Stop,&#x201D; Charlie grumbled. &#x201C;Both of you. Travis is right. Vogel&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Are you <em>serious</em>?&#x201D; Kate snapped. &#x201C;No way. You two don&#x2019;t know a thing about Vogel. I&#x2019;ve been here for <em>years</em>. If she were corrupt, I&#x2019;d be the first to know.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; he called, &#x201C;Earth to Stockholm. Ben had tapes with Vogel talking to his dad. They were conspiring big time, and Tabby&#x2019;s in on it too. It&#x2019;s all just a game to have a French Revolution without any guillotines.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Kate laughed, her voice becoming shrill. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t understand. It&#x2019;s way more likely that both of you are traitors than that Vogel&#x2019;s one. I&#x2019;m not listening to another word.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie made out Travis turning toward him in the darkness. &#x201C;We brought the gun back,&#x201D; he murmured. &#x201C;This is our fault.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Nah, kiddo. You were trying to do the right thing. I tried to get it back, but look where that got me.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Travis swallowed. &#x201C;Was that Heather with you?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie nodded. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s probably got the gun now. Turned on us.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not really that surprising, honestly.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Tell me about it,&#x201D; Charlie muttered. &#x201C;Who knows what she&#x2019;ll do with it now. Who knows why Vogel even wanted it in the first place. I don&#x2019;t think the mayor&#x2019;s keen on holding on to her power any longer.&#x201D;

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia followed Tabitha as they approached the crowd. It was seething, frothing, starved for blood and desperate for a drink. Under the Watchtower, not a hint of an employee remained &mdash; it was all guards. Tabitha parted them calmly, silencing their warnings, and Amelia trailed, emerging into the negative space between the two forces. The Resistance encircled the Watchtower, packed so dense that Amelia couldn&#x2019;t see the city in any direction without looking up. They were closing in.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And Vogel was leading them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Tabitha stopped just outside of her line of guards, mirroring the general. They were barely a hundred feet away, staring at one another for a long moment before Vogel held a hand up, telling her walking troops to stop. They did, but they weren&#x2019;t happy about it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia blinked. It seemed like months had passed since she had last seen Vogel, but there she was, in her jaded glory. Cold blonde hair, a weathered face, and a rubigun in her hand &mdash; and holstered on her belt, a cold gray handle. Amelia&#x2019;s stomach sank, and dread began to creep in. Charlie hadn&#x2019;t made it. More than ever, she was glad she&#x2019;d come, even as she started to wish she&#x2019;d done anything but.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Vogel raised her megaphone, still facing them. &#x201C;Your time is up! You&#x2019;ve been a tyrant to everyone in and around this city for years. No longer!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The crowd echoed the sentiment in a roar &mdash; thousands of cheers from Resistance, thousands from outliers, and tens of thousands from citizens. Vogel took a step forward, separating a bit more from them. In her periphery, Amelia saw five majors do the same around the circle.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The guards behind Tabitha tensed in response, and many hands hovered near rubiguns. Vogel didn&#x2019;t seem to notice.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Some of my majors tell me I should lock you up,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;Or let you take the train to York.&#x201D; She lowered her megaphone for a moment and grinned. &#x201C;But I am not my advisors. This ends here, and it ends <em>now</em>.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The crowd&#x2019;s reaction was almost violent. Amelia swallowed and took a step back, and Vogel&#x2019;s gaze snapped to her, eyes narrowing. Amelia stared back, trying to look defiant but mostly wilting under the stare.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Tabitha grimaced. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; she muttered under her breath, &#x201C;I appreciate the warning, at least.&#x201D; Before Amelia could say a thing, she raised her voice. &#x201C;Draw your weapons.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Do <em>not</em>,&#x201D; Vogel snapped, her voice carrying to every guard. &#x201C;Take a look around you &mdash; you have no chance. Now either you die here or you throw down your gun and join me. Better figure that out fast.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia was a little surprised to see dozens of guards in the ring raise their weapons tentatively. But those dozens were still swallowed up by the hundreds who dropped their rubiguns immediately and raised their hands in defeat. One by one, every guard still armed surrendered that arm, until Amelia and Tabitha stood completely alone, facing the mob staring them down.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia began to truly panic. Why had she even come here? She could be lying next to Margaret, being practically spoon-fed by Damien, safe from all of this. She&#x2019;d return as a veteran in a city under leadership probably more questionable than Tabitha&#x2019;s, and then... what? Maybe Vogel would have her killed, or maybe some oligarch would. Or <em>maybe</em>, just maybe, she&#x2019;d relax a little. Renounce Tabitha, beg for forgiveness from Vogel, and take up a job she actually enjoyed. Find someone nice, settle down, and live for twenty years before the dome failed and she died of the cold.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Stop looking so damn morose,&#x201D; Tabitha hissed to her. &#x201C;I have a thousand police officers. Only a few were stationed here.&#x201D; She sighed under her breath. &#x201C;God, I did <em>not</em> want to have to do this.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia shook her head numbly. Even ten thousand officers around this mob wouldn&#x2019;t be able to quell it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Vogel began to move forward, and the masses followed her, those with weapons holding them steady. Most of those weapons were pointed at Tabitha, Vogel&#x2019;s included &mdash; a simple rubigun like those around her. The ballistic was still kept securely on her belt.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia watched her grandmother tense, unmoving, as Vogel drew closer. The general couldn&#x2019;t have been more than fifty feet away, well within rubigun range, when Tabitha yelled, &#x201C;<em>Now!</em>&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Vogel stopped, still staring at Tabitha as a haunting smile spread slowly across her face. &#x201C;Was that for your undercover officers? They&#x2019;re with us now.&#x201D; She shook her head, almost laughing. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s cute how many backup plans you had.&#x201D; As suddenly as it had come, her expression disappeared back into a snarl. &#x201C;You would never go peacefully, never let a better woman take your place, never listen to what the people want.&#x201D; She gestured at something behind them. &#x201C;Keep them still.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia didn&#x2019;t have any time to react. One of the guards that had just been defending them grabbed her wrists, holding her back, and another did the same to Tabitha. A second set of hands closed around her ankles, and she couldn&#x2019;t move. She gave a probing squirm and knew immediately she could break free if she wanted. But it wasn&#x2019;t the time, and she stayed still, unable to think of anything but Charlie. <em>Back in my day, we waited days to break free from pins. </em>She didn&#x2019;t have days &mdash; every second felt like borrowed time.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Surround them.&#x201D; Vogel&#x2019;s megaphone was gone, clipped to her belt, and she had lost any semblance of an inspiring leader. This was all business.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The Resistance closed in, ringing the three of them in dark green. There was no gap, no escape route. Amelia took a deep breath and gritted her teeth, eyes focused on Vogel.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The general stepped forward, so close Amelia could have almost reached out and touched her if her wrists hadn&#x2019;t been pinned, and she showed a small smile. Her voice was so low when she spoke to Amelia that she was almost speaking to herself. &#x201C;Glad to see you&#x2019;re showing your true colors at last.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk to me about true colors,&#x201D; Amelia snapped. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a fake.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Vogel shrugged. &#x201C;Say what you want &mdash; you&#x2019;re still not making it out of here.&#x201D; She turned to Tabitha. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a pleasure.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The mayor just shook her head slowly, and when she spoke, her voice was loud enough to carry. &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t have to, you know. I was going peacefully.&#x201D; Her face crinkled up in disgust, and she spit at Vogel&#x2019;s feet. &#x201C;I never should have started the Resistance.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				That got attention. Those immediately around them began to murmur, and it spread to the people behind them. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t tell if it was swallowed up by the background noise of thousands, or became it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Vogel was unfazed. &#x201C;What nonsense. It&#x2019;s no wonder everyone wants you dead.&#x201D; Her hand moved to the metal handle at her belt, even as many in the crowd began to shout. &#x201C;Now&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Citizens of Los Angeles!&#x201D; The voice seemed to come from everywhere, and it took Amelia a moment to notice that the dozens of screens attached to the nearby buildings had lit up. Though she couldn&#x2019;t see the massive displays on the Watchtower behind her, everyone she saw could, and it had transfixed them all, including Vogel.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Your leader is a fraud. She&#x2019;s been collaborating with the government for years. All of this is nothing more than a show.&#x201D; Ben&#x2019;s voice rang out across the masses, and now Amelia was sure of it &mdash; they were unsettled. Even the members of the group surrounding the three of them were whispering to one another.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;And I have proof!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				That got Vogel&#x2019;s attention. Her eyes narrowed at the screen, and her hand settled on the ballistic.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben held up a familiar device and brought it close to the microphone, and Vogel&#x2019;s voice rang out.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				<em>The restructure is reaching the Resistance as we speak. The mayor&#x2019;s set to make her speech tomorrow morning.</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				<em>Yes. I&#x2019;ll be there. I&#x2019;ll propose a plant and she&#x2019;ll veto it and take the fall.</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben paused the playback. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s Richard Parkington. He and Vogel have collaborated in secret. Without him and the mayor, you wouldn&#x2019;t be here now.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				<em>She told me. Look, you don&#x2019;t need to keep me informed &mdash; I&#x2019;m closer to Emerson than you&#x2019;ll ever be. You&#x2019;re the one who needs information, not me.</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Mayor Emerson wanted Vogel to take over. She&#x2019;ll be the perfect successor. But Emerson didn&#x2019;t count on Vogel having this gun.&#x201D; Ben played the rest of the recording, but no one was paying any more attention. The world had crumbled into shouts and anger and confusion. No one seemed to know who to hate.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;We need a path forward,&#x201D; Ben continued, &#x201C;but it isn&#x2019;t through Vogel. It&#x2019;s through&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Suddenly, a hand clamped down on Ben&#x2019;s shoulder from off-screen. His eyes widened, and he shivered, skin going pale.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Turn it off.&#x201D; Everyone knew the voice &mdash; it had been played aloud moments before.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia yelled something, forgetting where she was. But it did no good. The broadcast clicked off as Ben was dragged out of the frame, and the crowd was left in stunned silence.

				Vogel was skittish. Amelia could see it in her face, in her movements. She stole glances at the green-jacketed Resistance around her without looking at them straight-on, clearly expecting an ambush.

				Amelia saw her former general&#x2019;s eyes widen like a panicked dog&#x2019;s. Saw her look suddenly for a way out and find none. Saw her gaze finally settle on Tabitha, now just a dozen feet away.

				Amelia didn&#x2019;t think &mdash; she hadn&#x2019;t stopped to in a long time. She just acted, twisting out of her wrist pin and falling forward, tucking into a roll and breaking free from the grasp on her ankles with the upward momentum. The distance was perfectly judged, and she rose up in front of Vogel, close enough to see all those wrinkles and signs of age that didn&#x2019;t fit. Not so fast that the general didn&#x2019;t have time to react and turn toward her, but fast enough that that was all she could do. Amelia came up with an arm outstretched, grabbing the gun and forcing it upward, even as Vogel pulled the trigger, the time too short for her to stop herself.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

				Amelia&#x2019;s world shrunk again. Now it was just the two of them, standing there, almost embracing. They stared up, just barely out from under the Watchtower&#x2019;s flare, in a moment that lasted so long Amelia was startled when it ended.

				A gossamer web spread across the sky like lightning, from the top of the dome all the way to the farmland, miles away. It stayed there, broken, for one more moment &mdash; this one fleeting.
