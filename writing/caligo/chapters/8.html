				The three of them sat in an uneasy truce around the breakfast table, the sun barely providing enough light to see by. It didn&#x2019;t come close to reaching their window at this hour, and it gave barely any heat. Not that it was what heated the city at all anymore, but still &mdash; the room was too cold, even for the end of fall.

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				They were silent, eating real bread and artificial jam &mdash; one item courtesy of Amelia and the other of Lucas &mdash; until Nate&#x2019;s insistent looks became too much.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Plans today?&#x201D; Amelia asked around a mouthful, already reaching for more. She ignored the knife Lucas pushed toward her and tore off a chunk instead, dipping one end in the jam.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Nate shook his head. &#x201C;Same as usual.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Lucas picked up the knife himself and set to work carving off a half-ragged slice of bread. &#x201C;Any of your friends got ideas for places to look?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Any glimmer of excitement in Nate&#x2019;s eyes dimmed. &#x201C;Nope.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia tensed, ready for him to say more, but he just reached for more bread. She wasn&#x2019;t about to bring it up with him, but she&#x2019;d only seen one other person around Nate for nearly a year &mdash; Tommy.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Have some jam,&#x201D; Lucas was saying. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s good for you.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;It tastes funny.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;It tastes like blackberries!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Nate finished off his pull of bread and pushed his chair away from the table. &#x201C;I think I&#x2019;m gonna head out.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You have money for lunch?&#x201D; At an offhand nod, Lucas swallowed. &#x201C;You know, if you ever want to talk&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t we all go ice skating sometime soon?&#x201D; Amelia broke in.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Lucas shot her a glare. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we can&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll be fun. I&#x2019;ll make reservations today. We should be able to get in next month.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Amelia&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Good.&#x201D; Her tone left no room for questions. &#x201C;That&#x2019;ll be fun.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Nate gave her a look, and she couldn&#x2019;t tell for the life of her if it was thankful or resentful. Then he left, and it was just the two of them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not actually going to make a reservation.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia shrugged and stood up, taking the plates to the sink to wash them and putting away the bread and jam. &#x201C;You hear Tabitha banned matches?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I already threw all of ours away.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;And you&#x2019;re just okay with that? Isn&#x2019;t there any part of you that thinks that&#x2019;s ridiculous?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Amelia, I just...&#x201D; Lucas sighed, longer than usual. &#x201C;Yes. Of course it&#x2019;s ridiculous. No one thinks matches are the problem. I don&#x2019;t know why she&#x2019;s doing what she&#x2019;s doing, but I trust her. She&#x2019;s got a reason.&#x201D; He pushed himself to his feet. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gotta go to work, and you&#x2019;re gonna go do whatever it is you do on the weekends these days.&#x201D; He picked up a rumpled dress shirt thrown over the back of the couch and began to button it up. &#x201C;Could you get some eggs on your way home?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia nodded. &#x201C;Sure. Got five grand?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t pretend you&#x2019;re going to the store.&#x201D; He picked up his suitcase, the oldest and priciest part of his ensemble by far, and walked out.

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Lucas often complained that their part of Los Angeles was rundown and dangerous, so close to the edge, but Amelia was fond of the area &mdash; there was barely any crowd and barely any noise.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Apart from the obvious &mdash; only five minutes had passed when she heard the crackle of old loudspeakers from above her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;This is a reminder that ballistic firearms are strictly prohibited inside Los Angeles,&#x201D; a female voice pleasantly announced. &#x201C;Possession of a firearm or ammunition is punishable by death on sight.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia sighed and kept walking. No one had ever tried to bring a real gun into the city in years, not that they would have any reason to. Burning someone senseless with a rubigun and then knifing them was just as effective as a bullet.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She passed a rotten grocery, a butcher shop, a brothel, every one shadier than the last. Patrons kept to the shadows, wearing hoodies or other face-obscuring clothing. A few illicit substances were exchanged in her view, and she did her best to keep her eyes straight ahead.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She was walking past a bakery that looked somewhat less dangerous than its neighbors when a figure burst out of it, making a mad dash into the street with a bag in his hand. He had barely made it five steps when a <em>thrum</em> sounded from the bakery and a wave of purple fire washed over him before dissipating almost instantly. He dropped to the asphalt, writhing from the flash burns, and his bag was reclaimed by the shooter &mdash; the aproned chef. Amelia kept moving.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The city babbled all around her &mdash; quieter than the center, but now not by much. Bicycle-drawn rickshaws plowed through the streets, ferrying customers through the city. Toward the south, an glass structure shaped like a donut cut in half lengthwise marked the beginning of the farmland. It protected the hydroponic crops below from anyone foolish enough to actually try taking some. Guards were positioned every hundred feet at the border between concrete and machinery, in case the explosion-resistant strengthened glass weren&#x2019;t enough to deter potential thieves.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia was nearly to the courtyard when she was almost knocked over. A woman wearing a balaclava barreled past her, a brown ponytail the only part of her that wasn&#x2019;t covered in black clothing. She shoved her way through the crowd, colliding with others, and moments later, two police officers sprinted out from a cross street directly in front of her, turning and chasing after their quarry.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Stop, Resistance! We have you surrounded!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia&#x2019;s ears pricked up, and she quickened her pace to get a better view of the action, pushing a few people out of the way herself. The woman had drawn a rubigun and was taking hip shots at the police with little success. Fireballs arced high in the air, pluming where they landed. With a glance behind her, the woman holstered her gun and pulled a baseball-sized sphere from her belt. With a <em>pop</em> that even Amelia could hear, the woman opened the capsule, removing a massive chunk of gray metal. She lobbed it at the officers with a grunt and dashed away.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia couldn&#x2019;t help but admire the two police in front of her. As the grenade flew through the air, already catching fire, both women immediately dropped to one knee and fired their rubiguns at the projectile. Some of the tiny pellets struck the larger chunk of rubidium, and the space above the middle of the street was suddenly filled with a massive but harmless ball of purple fire. It was gone just as quickly, though it took several moments for Amelia&#x2019;s eyes to recover from the blinding light they&#x2019;d been exposed to. When she could see clearly, the Resistance woman was gone.

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The crowds returned to normal before too long, as though nothing had happened, and Amelia eventually moved on too, reaching Charlie&#x2019;s courtyard barely on time.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Half a week had passed since she and Nate raided the Silver Dollar. Amelia was now actively looking for a job, but that was as hard as it had been when she was ten, if not harder. No one seemed to be hiring, and the few who were turned her away the moment she walked in the door with a complete lack of a resume.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She needed money.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia had stopped disturbing Charlie, letting him emerge of his own volition. This time he was very late &mdash; she&#x2019;d almost given up and left &mdash; but he had a grin on his face bigger than most she&#x2019;d seen from him. His hair was matted and a little singed, and he had a serious-looking burn on one cheek, but he didn&#x2019;t seem to notice or care.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I&#x2019;m done!&#x201D; He spread his arms magnificently, as though she knew remotely what he was building. &#x201C;Took me a month, but I got out unscathed.&#x201D; He glanced at his arm, red and angry from whatever he was working with. &#x201C;...well. Sorry to keep you, girl, but I just couldn&#x2019;t stop when I was that close to being done.&#x201D; His grin turned lopsided. &#x201C;Hey, I don&#x2019;t smell so bad you feel like you&#x2019;re going to spontaneously throw up, do I?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Uh... no?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Then it&#x2019;s a success! Just in time, too.&#x201D;
			</p>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie was even more energetic than usual, and he barely let her catch her breath between exercises. He scarfed his food even faster than usual, cold as it was, and was feverish in his teaching.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Of all the things she learned, the one Charlie impressed upon her the most was breaking free from pins. He would grab her wrists from behind, and she would twist them in precise ways to break free.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Not so fast,&#x201D; he said at one point, despite moving, talking and teaching faster than usual. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no rush to this. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll want to wait an hour before you try to break free.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia snorted. &#x201C;An hour? When would you ever want to wait?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie shook his head. &#x201C;You kids and your instant gratification. Back in my day, we waited days to break free from pins.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Breaking free was only the beginning, though, and after three grueling hours, Charlie dropped onto a bench, breathing a little heavy. He looked up at Amelia and grinned. &#x201C;Alright! I think that about does it.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She was dripping with sweat, so exhausted she was slow to understand his meaning. &#x201C;What, we&#x2019;re <em>done?</em> You haven&#x2019;t even taught me how to attack yet!&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;And I&#x2019;m not going to. Didn&#x2019;t we talk about this? You don&#x2019;t need to attack people &mdash; just get &#x2019;em angry and let them come at you.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia squinted at him. &#x201C;Do you want me gone?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie opened his mouth, probably to bite off a retort, but then closed it and sighed. &#x201C;No. But I have some things that are going to take up some more time now, after... that.&#x201D; He gestured vaguely toward the cellar.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia swallowed. She could connect those dots.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie looked at her, face drawn. &#x201C;You ever take that offer?&#x201D; She shook her head, and he studied her. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re good, you know. Really good. You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago.&#x201D; His expression hardened ever so slightly. &#x201C;Do your homework. Practice your rolls. For the love of god, keep your arms out.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia nodded. And after a second&#x2019;s thought, she hugged him, too. It took him a moment, but he hugged back.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				It only lasted a moment, and then she was picking up her backpack and starting to leave. &#x201C;Think you&#x2019;ll still have time for breakfast sometimes?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie smiled. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re offering, I&#x2019;m accepting. A man&#x2019;s gotta eat.&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

			<p class="body-text">
