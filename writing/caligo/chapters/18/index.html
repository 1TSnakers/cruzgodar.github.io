The trees barely moved in the late autumn breeze, but the grass swayed and danced in the slightest gust with childish vigor.</p><p class="body-text">Vigor was very far down Ben&#x2019;s list of emotions &mdash; worry and the maw of fear were closer at hand.</p><p class="body-text">They sat down on their usual bench and opened boxes of pasta &mdash; Ben had taken them to a fancier place and insisted on paying with no protest from Amelia. Richard&#x2019;s voice surfaced in his mind, telling him to look at how much she was taking. He almost laughed at the idea before feeling nauseous.</p><p class="body-text">Amelia finished long before he did, as usual. She set her box down on the grass and stared out at the city, worry slowly clouding her face, and Ben glanced at her after a moment. &#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I &mdash; yeah,&#x201D; she said, sounding like she&#x2019;d just woken up. &#x201C;Yeah, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D; Obviously that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, but <em>fine</em> covered his mental state, too.</p><p class="body-text">Ben seriously considered telling her for a long moment. Sure, she&#x2019;d be a liability, and sure, he wasn&#x2019;t <em>totally</em> sure he could trust her. But he couldn&#x2019;t entirely trust Heather, either &mdash; he couldn&#x2019;t even see her.</p><p class="body-text">He went back and forth a few more times while Amelia stared out into the sky, her gaze growing more and more distant. After a while, she seemed to realize neither one of them had spoken in minutes, and cleared her throat, drawing Ben out from his thoughts...</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s on your mind?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">...and his thoughts out from him. He couldn&#x2019;t wait &mdash; the anxiety was going to eat him alive if he didn&#x2019;t let it out. He wasn&#x2019;t about to talk here, though, not when there was every chance his hidden entourage was close enough to hear him, or even to see him whispering. But a crowd was never far away in Los Angeles, especially in the center. In fact, he was going that way regardless.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Follow me,&#x201D; he said, standing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">They could see it the entire trip, stabbing up into the sky like a glass javelin. Ben walked quickly, whether or not it was polite, and Amelia struggled to keep up through the ever-denser crowd. It wasn&#x2019;t a hot day &mdash; Ben couldn&#x2019;t remember the last one of those &mdash; but he sweated nonetheless, and by the time they neared the Watchtower he was half-drenched, breathing hard and wishing <em>dearly</em> he exercised more.</p><p class="body-text">At last, the buildings fell away, and they reached the city block that contained nothing but a plaza and the Watchtower itself. And so many people.</p><p class="body-text">Ben slowed to a walk and positioned himself in the middle of the throng, waiting for Amelia to join him. She bashed her way through with a scowl on her face, and when she reached him, she yelled, &#x201C;What are we doing here? This is the busiest place in the city!&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I know,&#x201D; Ben replied, quieter. Amelia strained to hear him, and he leaned in closer. &#x201C;I know. Look, I want to tell you something.&#x201D; His stomach lurched just saying that much, and he was uncomfortably aware that it sounded like he was asking her out. He shook his head and went on.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;That?&#x201D; He gestured to the Watchtower, and Amelia nodded. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m breaking into it tomorrow.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">It was a shot in the dusk. Amelia was far from rich, and she&#x2019;d been friends with a Resistance member. Even though she hated the organization, and rightly so, she might still sympathize with Ben&#x2019;s cause. He waited tensely for her response.</p><p class="body-text">Amelia looked for a long second as though she&#x2019;d misheard him, and even understanding took its time spreading across her face. Finally, she looked him in the eyes and asked, &#x201C;How?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">By then they&#x2019;d become a still point in the turning crowd, bodies flowing around them like a river parting for a stone. Ben let out a long breath. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s this woman,&#x201D; he said slowly. &#x201C;Heather. She can do... things... that can keep us from being seen.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">He pushed on, despite half his instincts telling him not to and the other half frozen in fear. &#x201C;And we need information on my father. He&#x2019;s&mdash;&#x201D; The words got stuck, and he cleared his throat, hating that he had to look so ridiculous just to get his point across. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s Richard Parkington. My father.&#x201D; Ben&#x2019;s face was as red as if he&#x2019;d been slapped, and he half expected to be.</p><p class="body-text">But when he opened an eye he hadn&#x2019;t realized was closed, Ben saw Amelia chewing on his words, looking like he had a few minutes ago &mdash; she had something she wanted to share with him too. So he kept quiet and waited, the best way to make someone talk.</p><p class="body-text">And she did, but with a response Ben didn&#x2019;t expect. &#x201C;An insider,&#x201D; she breathed. &#x201C;Working against the government.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben&#x2019;s brow furrowed and he opened his mouth to tell her he was <em>not</em> against any part of the government, thank you very much, but she continued before he could object.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m in the Resistance,&#x201D; she said, with a face that reminded Ben of glass that hadn&#x2019;t quite shattered. &#x201C;I got in through Charlie, and that&#x2019;s how I know Kate.&#x201D; She sucked in a breath. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going outside tomorrow.&#x201D; She didn&#x2019;t have to qualify it: <em>I might not come back</em>.</p><p class="body-text">Ben just stared at her, feeling something collapse inside him. He thought maybe he&#x2019;d known it since he met her, and just hidden it away from himself. Or maybe it didn&#x2019;t matter if he&#x2019;d known &mdash; maybe this was destined from the start. Break away from your family and make a friend and of course they&#x2019;d be the kind of person who wanted nothing more than to bring your family to its knees.</p><p class="body-text">He thought he might throw up. Why was he even helping Heather? Was that his own motivation, or was it just Amelia&#x2019;s, carried into him by osmosis?</p><p class="body-text">A look of revulsion crawled onto his face before he could stop it, and he didn&#x2019;t bother to once it was there. Of course Richard had been right the whole time. Of course. This was what she wanted from him. It was a serrated thought, ripping its way through and leaving emotions flailing like live wires.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;You kill people,&#x201D; he growled, louder than the ambient noise. He caught glances. &#x201C;You were behind the Kepler attack.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Amelia&#x2019;s face broke, and she shook her head forcefully. &#x201C;<em>No.</em> We didn&#x2019;t kill anyone &mdash; we evacuated the place beforehand. We&#x2019;re not terrorists.&#x201D; She didn&#x2019;t shout &mdash; more than anything, her voice was defeated. Ben recognized that tone without having to think &mdash; it meant he&#x2019;d already won.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a monster,&#x201D; he told her, even as the understanding of why there had been no casualties in the Kepler explosion finally clicked into place. &#x201C;You stand between us and peace.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I... what?&#x201D; Amelia shook her head, frowning. &#x201C;No! Why are you risking your life to break into the Watchtower if you&#x2019;re on Tabby&#x2019;s side?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text"><em>You wish to assist me in exposing him.</em> He didn&#x2019;t have an answer, but Amelia was still talking.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; she muttered, or as close to muttering as she could get in the middle of the crowd. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. I thought you were different.&#x201D; She waited for him to speak but eventually just went on herself.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Thanks for breakfast.&#x201D; She turned and started to melt into the crowd before stopping and looking back. &#x201C;Good luck.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">And she disappeared, leaving Ben alone among all the people in the world.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Why are we doing this?&#x201D; he asked the presence across from him.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;It was my assumption that we had ended that query.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;No. Really.&#x201D; Ben took a long drink of his latte &mdash; not decaf, this time, and with extra shots added. He needed something to wake him up from this dream he&#x2019;d found himself in. &#x201C;Suppose we find something. Something bad. What are we supposed to do? We can&#x2019;t spread the information ourselves, so what? We give it to a newspaper? Let them deal with it?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;This seems suitable.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;And then what? Maybe it&#x2019;s big. Maybe Richard loses everything. Am I supposed to live with that?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The lives of millions are at stake.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben brought his head up and looked straight at where Heather was, speaking before his eyes slipped away. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;You have had a change of perspective,&#x201D; she said in the same thick, flat voice.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;You know what? Maybe I have.&#x201D; Ben talked to the floor as if hanging his head in shame. &#x201C;Maybe I don&#x2019;t trust you anymore. Maybe you work for the Resistance too.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Heather took a long time to respond, and Ben had to strain to understand her words through the slipstream of her accent. &#x201C;I can tell you that you can trust me. I can tell you that I am not affiliated with any organization in the city, including the one specified. You may doubt this. But I can tell you something else with certainty, that you cannot doubt: if you do not do this, you will have less than if you do. You will have nothing.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben didn&#x2019;t trust himself to speak for a long moment, so he stayed silent, thinking over the words again and again.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The time today grows late. If you wish to help, meet me tomorrow on a bench in the Watchtower plaza. I will find you.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">And Heather left too, leaving behind a tiny yellow bag on her chair.</p><p class="body-text">Ben sat at his antique marble table, salvaged from the remains of Los Angeles by its lower class, and drank his coffee. He stayed until he absolutely had to leave to make it home on time.</p><p class="body-text">He was exhausted.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">In a daze through the lobby, passing familiar faces as distant as Amelia&#x2019;s, as unmemorable as Heather&#x2019;s. They had never been friends. Up the stairs, because he hadn&#x2019;t sweat enough. Past gamblers and janitors, eaters and cleaners, chefs and serfs. Up onto the twenty-fourth floor and down a plush carpet, imported from some distant country that had effectively vanished years ago. Past the crew of workers that smoothed the wrinkles from the fabric that formed when people walked on it, hunched over like farm workers in an age when farms no longer had workers at all.</p><p class="body-text">Down the hall, into his room, and onto the bed, breaking down into something like laughter.</p><p class="body-text">Because there was no question, never had been. Even as he questioned Heather, even as he wandered from Amelia with seeds of doubt planted long ago beginning to stir, even as he moved through the Golden Crown, a prisoner and a guard in his own house, Ben knew. There was never even a choice.</p><p class="body-text">He knew what he was going to do the next day. He knew how he was going to leave. He knew the bench he was going to find.</p><p class="body-text">Just like he knew he wouldn&#x2019;t get a second chance with Amelia.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script>"undefined"==typeof Page&&(""!==window.location.search?window.location.replace("/index.html?page="+encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname)+"&"+window.location.search.slice(1)):window.location.replace("/index.html?page="+encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname))),Page.settings ={"parent_list": "/writing/caligo"},Page.load()</script></body></html>
