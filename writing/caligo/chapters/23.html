			In the end, it all fell apart quite neatly.
			
			Plans. They were everywhere, little jigsaw pieces of a puzzle it took them a minute to even get a loose grip on. Sketches, employee lists, expense sheets, memos &mdash; it was a complete picture, just broken into tiny fragments. But slowly it became clear what they were dealing with: a prison. There was a map that confused him at first &mdash; the circle in the middle had to be the Watchtower, and the prison was marked just a few inches away from it. Had it really been under their noses the whole time?
			
			Then he saw the scale at the bottom, in ten-mile increments, and understood that the circle wasn&#x2019;t the Watchtower, but the dome itself. And that the prison was outside.
			
			There were many papers that resembled shopping lists. Some listed the citizens hired as guards and others the equipment given to each one. Ben scanned that list, stopping abruptly when he read the weapon. <em>Standard Issue Ballistic Rifle, 1</em>. They were using <em>ballistics</em> out there, nightmarish things capable of killing and wounding from hundreds of feet with extreme accuracy. Even Heather seemed surprised when he pointed it out to her, going silent for a while before speaking.
			
			All of this took one minute at most. Then the papers got pocketed, Heather carrying them under her arm so they wouldn&#x2019;t be visible &mdash; and they were out.
			
			Something deep inside him told Ben to leave the papers, but he knew better. If they&#x2019;d already sheared off the deadbolt in the door, Richard would know either way &mdash; even if they replaced the false-bottomed drawer, he would suspect. Heather could keep the papers for safekeeping, and Ben would weather out the storm of his father&#x2019;s suppressed, undirected rage. He could handle that &mdash; he&#x2019;d done it before. And then... things would go back to normal.
			
			He felt surprisingly dull at the thought as they left the office quietly and moved back down the center aisle. Did he really want normal?
			
			<em>You wish to assist me in exposing him</em>. Maybe, but what then? Ben swallowed, a familiar feeling coming back unrequested. What did he have, now that he&#x2019;d done the unthinkable?
			
			He didn&#x2019;t know.
			
			And he was so lost in his thoughts that he turned a corner into the two guards stationed at the elevator and didn&#x2019;t stop himself in time.
			
			It was immediate. Ben watched the man turn around, his expression shifting from surprise to anger. Then his eyes began to drift. And drift. Further and further, in what could only be a quarter of a second but felt like ten. His expression was still angry, the surprise of his moving gaze not registering yet. When they rolled into the side of his head, and a thin trickle of blood came out from under them &mdash; and he turned away, hands reaching up to cover his face &mdash; time ratcheted back to its normal speed, too fast for Ben to handle. His reactions were still stuck in slow motion as he watched another guard, behind the first, look toward him, see his eyes drift away, frown, and then draw his rubigun and fire in a swift motion. The purple fire roiled out of the barrel, out into the air as a fireball. Ben flinched, panic coursing through him.
			
			And then the fire hit, spreading purple across his body and his vision. Ben wondered when he was supposed to feel the burns or pass out from the shock. Maybe he was already unconscious? But &mdash; no, he felt fine. Then blackness began to spread across his vision in patches, and he waited tensely to lose consciousness until suddenly the entire blackness fell away and his normal vision was back. Ben looked at the ground in confusion and saw a dusting of black specks &mdash; burned robots.
			
			He stared dumbly at himself, taking a moment to process what had happened. He didn&#x2019;t even try to dodge the second blast.
			
			But something flickered in the air in front of him, and the fire caught and singed another figure, now crouched on the ground. Like they&#x2019;d done to him, the tiny drones died and fell away, revealing... a figure.
			
			&#x201C;Imbecile,&#x201D; Heather growled, and Ben could <em>see</em> her, but now there wasn&#x2019;t time for that &mdash; she&#x2019;d jumpstarted him into action.
			
			The guard still had a rubigun, trained on Ben, and he fired just as Heather leapt and pushed the pistol up, making the shot fire into the ceiling and scatter bits of flaming rubidium. It was a blessing the whole building was fireproof.
			
			The guard swung his free hand at Heather&#x2019;s temple, colliding with a dull <em>thunk,</em> and she didn&#x2019;t make a sound, just hit back harder. The breath left him as he fell back, but as Heather grabbed his pistol to pull it from his hand, the guard&#x2019;s last bits of consciousness pulled the trigger. A blast of purple fired into Heather&#x2019;s torso, splashing up and near her face. Ben barely processed that she had the papers held behind her back, keeping them safe.
			
			Even as the flames plumed against her, she yanked the rubigun from the guard&#x2019;s grip, staggered, stumbled, and finally stood straight, half her body scorched, before turning and firing at the other guard. He still had his hands over his eyes, and when he fell, and they fell away, Ben saw blood smeared all across his face.
			
			&#x201C;He will live,&#x201D; Heather said. &#x201C;We may not. Move.&#x201D; She pressed the elevator button with the barrel of her gun and picked up the yet-unfired rubigun from its owner. She kept it and gave the other to Ben. &#x201C;This contains only one charge. Use it carefully.&#x201D;
			
			When he&#x2019;d had first read about rubiguns, and how the five-charge capacity was the biggest flaw, he&#x2019;d thought that was ridiculous. No one needed five charges to fight &mdash; two or three would be plenty.
			
			He thought he understood a little better now.
			
			It helped to think of rubiguns and books, not the possibly-blind and definitely-unconscious men behind them. Not that there were security cameras everywhere. Not that if there hadn&#x2019;t been reinforcements coming before, there definitely would be now. And definitely not that he couldn&#x2019;t go back to the Golden Crown&mdash;
			
			The elevator reached their floor with a metallic <em>ding</em>, and Heather stuck the barrel of her rubigun into the opening gap and fired three times. Then she darted to the side, pulling Ben with her. When no one came from within, Heather stepped slowly &mdash; and <em>very</em> strangely, he couldn&#x2019;t help but notice &mdash; back in front of the doors, then in. He followed, stepping over four more bodies that Heather quickly got out of the carriage. She pushed the button for the lobby, the doors closed at an agonizing pace, and they were off.
			
			Ben breathed in and felt a mass of dangerous thoughts bursting at the seams of his mind. Breathed out and decided to look at Heather instead.
			
			She towered over him, at least six feet, and her pale blonde hair hung halfway down her back, packed into a tight braid. Her skin was <em>extremely</em> pale, like some sort of cave dweller&#x2019;s, or outlier&#x2019;s, or someone who spent their days encased in light-reflecting robots.
			
			But she looked normal enough beyond that, wearing a long-sleeve flannel and cargo pants and boots and holding hundreds of papers and a rubigun. Her expression was perfectly neutral &mdash; and that, at least, was what he&#x2019;d imagined.
			
			The floors ticked by on the old display. Twenty-two. Eighteen. Fourteen. Twelve. <em>Ding.</em>
			
			As they lurched to a halt, Heather moved with a liquid grace that was off in a way Ben couldn&#x2019;t put his finger on, pushing him to one of the corners near the door and crouching against the other herself. She leveled her gun at the doors&#x2019; center and Ben shakily followed suit. Then they opened, and balls of fire came pouring in.
			
			Ben flinched but kept his rubigun steady, and it turned out fine. The only places he was hit he was clothed, and although that left him with holes all over, he was unhurt.
			
			Heather shot the first guard as soon as she entered, holding down the button to close the door with her other hand. The guard collapsed outside, and Heather pivoted to standing square in the doorway, firing off three more shots before the closing doors stopped her.
			
			She looked at Ben as they continued their descent. &#x201C;If you refuse to make use of your weapon, I will appropriate it.&#x201D;
			
			Ben gladly handed over the gun, and Heather flicked open the barrel to reveal a single plastic sphere holding a chunk of silvery metal inert in a coating of argon. She placed it in her own rubigun and flicked it closed.
			
			The whole process took no longer than two seconds, but Ben watched it carefully. Not a single part of her body ever moved quickly &mdash; no fast-twitch reflexes. It was all smooth arcs through the air, like she was planing every motion in advance. He didn&#x2019;t really know what to think.
			
			The elevator stopped again at the fifth floor, the ding sounding mocking to him. The doors opened, no shots came through, and Heather held down the door close button, pointing her rubigun straight at the wide-open gap.
			
			The doors began to close, and then a boot slid between them, and they opened once more.
			
			Heather darted across the elevator, firing a shot as she moved. Three more came back at her, scattering in the small space and singeing Ben&#x2019;s clothing again, though most hit Heather this time.
			
			Three women charged into the lift before either of them had a chance to react. The first went down immediately from a well placed shot by Heather, but the other two kept moving. Heather immediately ducked the first blast, slipped behind one of the two, and clocked her with a now-empty rubigun. The guard crumpled immediately.
			
			The last one ignored her companion, turning to Ben. In the span of half a second, she raised her pistol, pointed it at his face, and lurched forward as a rubigun hit the back of her head.
			
			Heather kicked a stray foot out of the doorway, stood with one foot on each of the two unconscious bodies in the elevator in case they woke up sooner than expected, and a moment later, the doors closed. She extracted two rubiguns and pocketed one, but after a moment, pulled it back out and thrust it at Ben. &#x201C;This may bring peace of mind, if nothing else. Prepare yourself. Follow me.&#x201D;
			
			And then the elevator stopped &mdash; they were at ground level.
			
			The doors <em>dinged</em>, and slid open, and Heather bolted out, firing a preemptive shot as she did so. Ben followed at the same speed, adrenaline helping him forget how very out of shape he was.
			
			And here they all were.
			
			Heather took shot after shot, fire raining down on the tight circle of police that had assembled in front of the elevator. She forged a way through, absorbing dozens of blasts of fire straight to her face, and Ben barely made it through behind, using her like a shield. And then they were out of the Watchtower, sprinting through the plaza, fire slamming into the pavement behind them. There were incongruous shouts, both for them to stop and for the police to run faster, but Ben barely heard any of them, following Heather because his life depended on it.
			
			They splashed into the crowd, throwing aside bodies like water. It was only when the people became more viscous that Heather finally slowed to a gliding walk. After five minutes and several turns down random streets, she stopped suddenly and turned to Ben, and he was reminded unpleasantly of his last conversation with Amelia.
			
			The crowd eddied around them, so noisy that Ben couldn&#x2019;t hear properly. Or maybe that was the ringing in his ears. Heather was trying to tell him something, but it took three times for him to understand her. When he finally focused, he stepped back in fright. Her entire face was burned and charred from the fire, still smoking even now. But she barely even seemed to notice, and was talking like nothing was wrong.
			
			&#x201C;I must attend to my work. You may possess the documentation. I will recreate my mental copy.&#x201D;
			
			Ben stared at her, glazed-eyed. &#x201C;What?&#x201D; He took the stack of papers she thrust at him without thinking.
			
			&#x201C;I thank you for your help.&#x201D;
			
			Absolutely not. &#x201C;Absolutely not.&#x201D;
			
			Heather&#x2019;s expression never changed. &#x201C;You are a liability and a difficulty. I can no longer afford you accompanying me.&#x201D;
			
			&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t leave me!&#x201D; Ben shook his head. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t just leave me.&#x201D;
			
			&#x201C;I am not abandoning you. If you need my help, I do not doubt you can find me.&#x201D;
			
			Ben looked up into Heather&#x2019;s eyes, noticing what a sickening green they were for the first time. He started to say the words and stopped &mdash; they were so against what he&#x2019;d been taught. And then he realized he didn&#x2019;t care what he&#x2019;d been taught, because he couldn&#x2019;t go back. His thoughts didn&#x2019;t go any further than that, but in the moment, it got him the three words.
			
			&#x201C;I hate you.&#x201D;
			
			And he turned and walked into the crowd with a loaded rubigun in his pocket and a stack of papers under his arm.

			The veneer broke quickly. A few blocks away, Ben&#x2019;s angry expression shook and cracked and shattered like glass, and he had to stop and draw a long breath to keep himself from breaking down even more. He pushed on instead, shoving people out of the way. They didn&#x2019;t need to get where they were going as much as he did.
			
			As if he knew where he was going. For the better part of an hour, it was just away from the Golden Crown, but eventually, he knew he had to be specific. He sighed and took a few minutes to figure out exactly where he was &mdash; a surprisingly hard thing to do when he had rarely been outside and had never been near this part of the city. Eventually, he oriented himself, faced southeast, and zigzagged along the blocks.
			
			Afternoon was growing tired by the time he got there. Ben had spent three hours speeding through the city, glancing behind his shoulder with every step and suspecting everyone of everything. He was approaching exhaustion, but he still found the energy to be nervous as he stepped up to the door.
			
			He knocked. Knocked again. Again. Please. Again. And again. And again, until he knew no one was home.
			
			Ben&#x2019;s breath was shaky as he tried to come up with a plan. What he decided on wasn&#x2019;t really one, but it was a direction at the very least, and walking was distraction enough.
			
			Stonewall park came into view as the last embers of sunset were snuffing out. Ben climbed the hill to the plateau, speckled with trees, and picked one at random, placing a stone on his papers to keep them from blowing away. He laid down, already cold, but at least the grass was soft. Before long he was almost getting comfortable.
			
			And then he thought of Richard, and how he would search, how he would scour every place Ben had visited when he&#x2019;d been outside before.
			
			So he pushed himself to a standing position and picked up the stone and the papers and trudged down the other side of the hill. Half a mile away, he found an alley that dead-ended but was filled with dumpsters, and he walked to the end of it, slumped against the wall behind one of them, and sank down into a sitting position, thoughts spiraling.
			
			The stone went back on the papers and the rubigun came out of his pocket, the safety on but his grip tight. The evening washed out into night, and he shivered against the wall, contributing a little to that ocean.
