It wasn&#x2019;t as constant as the bubbling of unchanged oil, or as annoying as the shouts of superiors and subordinates, but it was worse in its own way, lurching every day into motion and mocking her as she left.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text"><em>Click.</em></p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia punched her timecard on Monday and grabbed her apron off the rack before stepping up to the front counter amidst the burbling of oil. She was thirteen, too young technically to be working by law, but no one had asked, she would have lied anyway, and the law was never enforced. She smiled and helped the first customer of the day.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text"><em>Click</em>.</p><br><p class="body-text">It was Tuesday, and she was fourteen. She worked the register, no more than a locked drawer of cash, every day of the week, nine to five. The pay was meager, only a thousand an hour. It was less than a quarter of minimum wage. She didn&#x2019;t complain.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia had cut her hair, taking it from shoulder- to neck-length. It was still a dull brown, but she had neither the desire nor the money to change that.</p><br><p class="body-text">She took a little longer to smile than before, but it was there eventually &mdash; until the sound of oil spilling in the back reached her, accompanied by a scream.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text"><em>Click.</em></p><br><p class="body-text">Thursday. Fifteen. Amelia served the trickle of customers that still showed up with perfect indifference, bringing them the grease-stained pastries they asked for. The oil vat had spilled twice more in the past year, burning five employees in total. One hadn&#x2019;t shown up again, but the other four brought their injuries to work with them and healed on their feet. There was never even a choice.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text"><em>Click, click, click.</em></p><br><p class="body-text">Day after day trickled by. On some of them she tried to smile. On most she didn&#x2019;t waste the effort. She was lucky to serve eight customers in the eight hours she worked, now only three days a week. She remembered a time long gone when she had eaten some of the store&#x2019;s pastries for lunch, and even long before that, when she had begged her father to take her there for donut holes.</p><br><p class="body-text">There were still donut holes, but they had changed. Or maybe that was her.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text"><em>Click.</em></p><br><p class="body-text">She liked to think this one sounded better than the morning&#x2019;s, but her freedom sounded the same as the shackles going on at sunrise.</p><br><p class="body-text">Now, at least, she was free to breathe in the balmy evening air and walk the four miles home. Ann&#x2019;s Pastries was almost exactly as far in from the edge as her brothers&#x2019; apartment &mdash; just enough to be out of the outskirts, but no more. As the cymbals of the city grew softer, heralding the night, Amelia finally let herself relax. This was the only time she had to herself on workdays. She woke up at seven, got to Ann&#x2019;s by nine, worked until five, and when she got home, there was dinner to make as often as not, and her two brothers occupied the rest of her attention. It was her walks home, when she wasn&#x2019;t trying to get anywhere or do anything in a hurry, that she had the chance to feel just a little at peace.</p><br><p class="body-text">Little scraps of things littered the street &mdash; anything sizable was gone almost before it was there. There weren&#x2019;t many people, either, and she had the asphalt to herself. There wasn&#x2019;t much distinction between sidewalk and road these days.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia took a deep breath in and tried to let it out slow. She didn&#x2019;t do too well. The weekend was here, and she was free, but these days, that brought as much anxiety as it did relief &mdash; she had no plans, and she wouldn&#x2019;t be making any.</p><br><p class="body-text">She glanced toward the Watchtower in the city&#x2019;s center. It had some official name, but like so many other things, no one had ever used it. It rose above even the other skyscrapers, and looking down one of the streets that led all the way there, Amelia could see the very top glowing yellow in the twilight.</p><br><p class="body-text">An hour passed, and still that light shone. Lucas would be leaving the Watchtower around now, starting his own hour-long walk home. As she watched, more and more of the building&#x2019;s lights flickered off, but that top floor always stayed lit. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t help but stare, as if she could see into that room from five miles away.</p><br><p class="body-text">She could imagine everything that went on in there, even if she&#x2019;d never seen a glimpse of the inside. The place was as familiar as her own home, and as uncomfortable.</p><br><p class="body-text">It made her glad her last name was common.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia had no idea how long she stayed in that eddy of thoughts, but when the businessman stepped out a block in front of her, she was glad to be pulled away.</p><br><p class="body-text">He was carrying a briefcase and looking around nervously. And rightly so &mdash; if she were in his shoes, she&#x2019;d never have set foot out near the edge of the city, especially not with money.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia had little idea what she was doing and less of a clue why. She dropped into a crouch because it felt right, softened her footsteps because she thought it was what pickpockets did. Padding up behind the man, she started to reach into one of his pockets&mdash;</p><br><p class="body-text">The man stopped in his tracks and turned around to see a scrawny little girl right behind him. Amelia stared back at him, fear lacing her thoughts. She had a chance to run, to hit him, to duck.</p><br><p class="body-text">She did nothing, frozen, and got hit.</p><br><p class="body-text">It was only when she could see properly again, blinking her vision back, that Amelia realized the man had a holstered rubigun. But he was already walking away, and she could only be glad it hadn&#x2019;t ended worse.</p><br><p class="body-text">She had fallen over, and getting back to her feet was a shaky process. Her jaw throbbed, but when she felt it, she was fairly sure it wasn&#x2019;t broken. She had no idea what a broken jaw felt like, but still.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia swallowed, closed her eyes, and took another deep breath. It wasn&#x2019;t getting any easier.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text">The apartment was a crooked little thing on the ground level of a corner building, painted a peeling, uneasy blue. Amelia opened the door with the key around her neck and stepped into a living room, kitchen, and bedroom combined.</p><br><p class="body-text">A stick-thin figure stood at the counter, next to a pot that looked like it was smoking, and Amelia smiled for the first time in hours, if faintly. &#x201C;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Making dinner.&#x201D; Nate stuck his bottom lip out at her. He was standing on tiptoe, trying to pull a can off a shelf.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Uh huh.&#x201D; She smiled, only a little at his expense. &#x201C;And what are you making?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Soup.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s nice.&#x201D; Amelia stepped over to glance at the large pot on the stove. &#x201C;You gonna add some water to that?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate shot her a mostly-joking glare. &#x201C;I was getting there.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">The paste in the bottom of the pot had long since gotten there &mdash; what looked like smoke from the door had, in fact, been smoke. Amelia didn&#x2019;t say anything, just took the pot to the sink and filled it halfway. She kept her head inclined, trying to keep the bruise from sight.</p><br><p class="body-text">Ten minutes later, when the soup was simmering quietly, all the adrenaline from the encounter had finally drained away. Amelia took a seat at the little table that threatened to collapse any day and motioned for Nate to join her, and he sat down with a bounce of the auburn hair that was the size of his face.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Wanna play a game?&#x201D; That was Nate talking, not her &mdash; Amelia couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she&#x2019;d asked to play one of her brother&#x2019;s card games. But she nodded tiredly and watched the ten-year-old scurry to a shelf and return with two decks. That was a good sign, at least &mdash; she stopped understanding his games around the four-deck mark.</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate dealt and explained the rules he&#x2019;d made up, and Amelia followed along with most of her attention. After ten minutes, she was finally dealt her hand, and she could relax just a little.</p><br><p class="body-text">She played an ace, not sure if it was high or low, and glanced up at him. &#x201C;How was your day?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Fine.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia raised an eyebrow. She&#x2019;d spent months learning how, and now it was finally paying off. &#x201C;Just fine?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate shrugged. &#x201C;Tommy wasn&#x2019;t there.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Huh. He said he would be?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate shook his head. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s always there on Fridays, &#x2019;cause his sister&#x2019;s busy all day, so&mdash;&#x201D; He frowned. &#x201C;Look, if you play that queen on your four, you&#x2019;ll get three times the points. See?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; Amelia moved the card and drew another. Another queen, this one of hearts. She remembered Nate saying something about two queens, but she couldn&#x2019;t remember whether it won or lost her the game, so the card stayed in her hand.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s probably just sick,&#x201D; she told Nate. &#x201C;He&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; It was impossible not to hear the uncertainty in his voice, though.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia was losing badly, and she was about to just play the other queen when the front door opened. The figure silhouetted by the fading sunlight outside towered almost to the top of the doorframe, but he seemed to lose a inch as he stepped inside, hanging up a threadbare coat on a peg driven into the wall. He looking at the two of them with blue eyes that shone like ice and smiled slightly. &#x201C;Caught her off guard, huh? Not easy to rope her into that.&#x201D; He took a deep breath and lost another inch on the exhale, walking toward the old couch that doubled as a bed. &#x201C;Thanks for making dinner, Amelia.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;That was Nate!&#x201D; Amelia looked up at him. &#x201C;All by himself.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas raised his eyebrows and looked at his younger brother. &#x201C;What a wonderful surprise, Nate. Thank you.&#x201D; And he smiled.</p><br><p class="body-text">It was such a nice moment. Amelia didn&#x2019;t realize she wanted it to last until she realized it couldn&#x2019;t.</p><br><p class="body-text">It couldn&#x2019;t, because the next thing Lucas did was look at her, with her face tilted up toward him and the bruise on her neck and lower jaw perfectly visible.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Amelia.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">She tried to clench her teeth, but the pain was too intense. &#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas let out a long breath and ran a hand over his face. &#x201C;What do you mean, what?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I can do what I want. You don&#x2019;t&mdash;&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;This is the third time this month! Is that just how it&#x2019;s going to be from now on? You come home once a week from a fight?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not&mdash;&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;What do you do with all your spare time, anyway? Is there some kind of fighting ring you&#x2019;re a part of?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate looked back and forth between them, almost lazily. There was nothing new here, not for any of them.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia just glared at Lucas, and he glared back. Finally, he shook his head and sat down heavily on the couch. &#x201C;You need another job.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas looked up at her, his eyes tired. &#x201C;I mean it. Come on, Amelia, you&#x2019;re not doing anything productive on your days off. It&#x2019;s not like you have any friends.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia rarely let herself grow angry at these exchanges anymore, but this was more than she could handle right now. She stood up carefully, trying not to let her frustration control her, and walked out the front door, stepping into the warm night air. She couldn&#x2019;t resist slamming the door behind her.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text">There was a rain gutter in the alley next to the apartment building, next to useless now &mdash; the last storm had been more than ten years ago. Now it was nothing more than a ladder.</p><br><p class="body-text">She&#x2019;d set her mind to getting to the top years ago, and it hadn&#x2019;t taken her long. With carefully placed hands and feet, Amelia scaled the three stories of the building in moments, pulling herself up onto the slanted rooftop. She walked carefully to the middle, where it flattened out, and sat down, alone once again.</p><br><p class="body-text">A half-dozen miles away, the sun was almost out of sight below the farmland. The sky around it glowed red and orange, and little specks of light shone through. Amelia stared out at it with just a little longing. Her father had told her once that looking at the sun used to hurt &mdash; that it could blind, even &mdash; back when it was millions of miles away. This sun had to be so much dimmer than the real thing had been.</p><br><p class="body-text">That, or people just couldn&#x2019;t see quite as well these days.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia reached under a small nook in the roof and drew out a smaller ceramic jug. She&#x2019;d found it there the first time she made it to the top and had never told a soul. The cork came off with a hollow noise, and she shook the contents out onto the fireproofed wood of the roof &mdash; a flutter of bills, most of them ten and twenty thousands, but a single fifty among them too.</p><br><p class="body-text">In total, Amelia had two hundred and ten thousand dollars. It wasn&#x2019;t a fortune by any stretch, maybe enough for three months&#x2019; rent. She couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she&#x2019;d really spent any of it, not sure what she was saving for but sure it was a good idea. She added the latest four thousand, replaced the bills and the lid, and tucked the jug safely away.</p><br><p class="body-text">The sun was setting, and autumn was getting well underway. Not that that meant much &mdash; the temperature hadn&#x2019;t dropped below fifty in years. It was a few degrees colder in the winter, but the trees were still green and the skies still clear. A train would arrive on the solstice, and that was about as much fanfare as the city would get.</p><br><p class="body-text">The moment slipped away, and suddenly the sun had set completely. Amelia let out a long breath she barely knew she&#x2019;d been holding, still staring at the fading red where the sun had been. The city was cloaked in night now, and the stars had begun to come out, little specks of light that were no more than clumps of pixels on a faraway screen.</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text">She couldn&#x2019;t stay long. Back down the rain gutter, back in through the front door, back to the dimly-lit apartment that smelled of recently unconcentrated soup.</p><br><p class="body-text">Nate sat at the table, playing some kind of solitaire variant, and Lucas was on the couch, squinting at a neon green sheet of paper. It was organic material, endlessly recyclable and easy to print on, and everyone but the richest who wanted news got it in that form. This was a smaller newspaper &mdash; Lucas refused to spend the extra hundred or two to get something like the Times &mdash; but it was still news, however sketchy the sources.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia wanted to apologize to him, to smooth things over and eat dinner on speaking terms. If not for her own sake, then for Nate&#x2019;s &mdash; he&#x2019;d given her a glance when she stepped in and then gone back to his game, and she couldn&#x2019;t help but feel that in her stomach.</p><br><p class="body-text">She couldn&#x2019;t make herself do it. She just clenched her jaw and told herself everything would be fine if she just pretended it was. &#x201C;Anything interesting?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas glanced up at her, studying her for a minute, before shrugging. &#x201C;Define interesting. There&#x2019;s a new fine for biking without a helmet.&#x201D; He scratched absently at his beard. &#x201C;And some kid got shot.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Some kid?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Yeah. Apparently they haven&#x2019;t identified the body.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;The body?&#x201D; Amelia grimaced. &#x201C;What, he died? Who shot him?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Police. He was stealing apples from a government vehicle.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia scowled and opened her mouth, ready to argue. It was only at the last moment that she forced it shut.</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas just stared at her and sighed, looking behind her after a moment and pushing himself up. &#x201C;Soup&#x2019;s ready.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text center-if-needed"><span>- - -</span></p><br><p class="body-text">They ate in relative silence, sipping on what supposedly was made from tomatoes but tasted like pure salt. Nate tried a few times to engage both of them, but eventually even he gave up. He checked the clock constantly, and pushed his chair away from the table a little after seven.</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas glanced at him. &#x201C;Going somewhere?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Yeah, I&#x2019;m gonna meet some friends at Bryce&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Did you finish your soup?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Yep.&#x201D; Nate was already leaving. &#x201C;Night!&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">The door closed behind him, and Lucas ran his hands over his balding head, letting out a long sigh. &#x201C;I barely recognize him anymore,&#x201D; he murmured. &#x201C;I barely see him, I don&#x2019;t know who any of these friends are. You ever heard of Bryce?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia shook her head, staring at her soup.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Me neither.&#x201D; He paused, still looking at the door, and eventually swallowed. &#x201C;Can you talk to him more when you get the chance?&#x201D; When he got no response, Lucas stood up, gathering the dishes. &#x201C;He was always more open with you.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia grunted. &#x201C;Whose fault is that?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas shot her a glance. &#x201C;Really? You really want to bring that up again?&#x201D; He turned around and walked to the sink. &#x201C;It was Kroffman&#x2019;s fault, not mine.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;I wish I could burn that place to the ground,&#x201D; Amelia muttered.</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas stopped washing dishes for just a moment, the water still running, before slowly continuing. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was furious or if he agreed.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;How was work?&#x201D; he asked eventually. His voice was carefully level.</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia almost laughed. &#x201C;You know how it was. You?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas shrugged. &#x201C;It was fine. More papers to deliver than usual.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">The conversation lapsed, and before long, Lucas had washed the bowls and returned to the couch. Amelia watched him for a moment, looked at the newspaper, glanced at the small stack of books near a wall that Nate loved so much. There wasn&#x2019;t anything left for her in the day. And there wouldn&#x2019;t be anything that weekend, either, just like there hadn&#x2019;t been for months. She couldn&#x2019;t stomach the thought of just going to bed.</p><br><p class="body-text">So she took the alternative.</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;How do you kill a kid with a rubigun?&#x201D; she muttered.</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas looked up from the paper. &#x201C;Come on, you can&#x2019;t possibly be on his side here. You steal and you pay for it.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Right, and you die when you try to take some apples. That makes sense. You think Tabitha signed off on that personally?&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t <em>call</em> her that. You have no idea how hard it is to be mayor.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia gave a hollow laugh. &#x201C;And you do?&#x201D; She stared him down, half a foot taller though he was. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s our <em>grandmother,</em> Lucas. The most powerful person in the city, and she won&#x2019;t admit we exist.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know her.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Neither do you. And I don&#x2019;t think you ever will.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Lucas&#x2019;s face twisted into a grimace, and after a long moment, he shook his head and turned away. &#x201C;This is why you don&#x2019;t have any friends.&#x201D;</p><br><p class="body-text">Amelia wanted to head outside, to go wander the streets and come back after everyone else was long asleep. She wanted to go back up to the roof and be alone with her thoughts. She wanted to go knock on the door of one of those friends she didn&#x2019;t have and empty her emotions out, talk them through until they finally made sense to her.</p><br><p class="body-text">So she walked the ten feet to the bathroom and shut the door and cranked the shower as high as it would go. And tried not to scream.</p><br><p class="body-text">The walls were thin, and she had to ignore the sounds of Lucas opening a bottle and pouring himself a drink, the one expense he allowed himself. She ignored the sounds of him sinking back into the couch and letting out an exhausted sigh.</p><br><p class="body-text">She didn&#x2019;t know what she was looking for &mdash; maybe didn&#x2019;t even know that she was looking at all. But her future was already tangling, sketching a path she was drawn to follow, no matter the outcome.</p><br><p class="body-text">Her mother had named her Amelia, in a world where explorers still commanded the skies. Now the world was ten miles across, with not a plane to be seen. The hot water scoured away her anger, leaving nothing but resentment underneath, and all she could do was hope that tomorrow would be easier.</p><br><p class="body-text">And that there was a little more exploring to be done.</p><br><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script>if (typeof Page === "undefined"){if (window.location.search !== ""){window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname) + "&" + window.location.search.slice(1));}else{window.location.replace("/index.html?page=" + encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname));}}Page.settings = {"title": "Caligo: Bright Lights","writing_page": true,"small_margins_on_ultrawide": true,"parent_list": "/writing/caligo"};Page.load();</script>
