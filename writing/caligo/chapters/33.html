			</p>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I was under the impression that you were the diplomat.&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Well, I have had training in diplomacy and argument, but I don&#x2019;t think I would say that I&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I will direct the conversation.&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; Ben gave a nervous laugh, the mustache on his lip scratching like a wool sweater. &#x201C;So I won&#x2019;t need to say anything, then?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Correct. Presently included.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben shut up and followed as they approached the door. The grass was blackened and dead around it, and chunks of torn metal and burned wood littered the scene. The hole itself was still open, but Heather ignored it and approached the first-floor door. She ran her hands over the surrounding metal, and after a moment, she stopped, flexed her arm, and popped open a hidden keypad. Her hand moving faster than it should have been able to, she pressed every key, reached the bottom, hit the submit button, and started again.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				It wasn&#x2019;t long before a voice echoed from the keypad. &#x201C;What?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Heather leaned in and flicked her police badge at where Ben assumed there was a camera. &#x201C;I am under direct orders from Mayor Emerson to inspect these premises.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The line was silent for a time before the man spoke up again. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t recognize you. Where&#x2019;s Parkington?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben&#x2019;s blood froze, and a shiver ran from the back of his head to the soles of his feet. It shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised him, but it felt shocking all the same.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;It is not of your concern if I appear different from who you expected. I belong to the second battalion, and consequently do I have the authority to gain lawful entry.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Another long pause. Ben had to hand it to her &mdash; this speech almost sounded normal.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Second battalion, huh?&#x201D; the voice asked at last. &#x201C;And what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Maria Goodwin.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Okay, officer Goodwin. I just need to pull up your face data, and then I can let you in.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben&#x2019;s heart skipped another beat. Fifteen seconds in, and the plan was already off track. They&#x2019;d have to break in, or hack into the security systems, or maybe Heather could find another way to make them invisible. But she had to do <em>something</em>, didn&#x2019;t she? She couldn&#x2019;t just stand there and wait for the guard to realize he wasn&#x2019;t talking to Maria Goodwin at all.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				But, no, she was stepping to the side, out of view of the camera, and starting to taking off her hoods. Ben stared, willing her to do something.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And she did, but he wished dearly that it had been anything else.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Gradually, so quietly that at first he could barely notice it, he became aware of a squishing sound. It was the kneading of too-wet bread dough and the slop of mud combined in the worst way, and it made him want to throw up without a second thought. He was grateful not to be in the camera&#x2019;s line of sight.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Officer Goodwin?&#x201D; The voice was back. &#x201C;Are you there?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D; Heather wiped her face with a hand, and Ben thought it looked shiny in the faint starlight. She walked back in front of the camera, still turned away from Ben.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;My apologies, officer. A guard will admit you momentarily.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;This is satisfactory.&#x201D; Heather stepped back in front of the door and faced Ben.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				With the face of the woman she&#x2019;d left unconscious ten minutes ago. Blood trickled from her eyes and nose, smeared slightly from where she&#x2019;d wiped it away. Her skin was wrinkled and cracked and raw, and every proportion was off &mdash; the skin was stretched tight over her nose, bigger than it had been, and her eyes were too small for their sockets, the eyelids bunched up with skin. Her mouth hung loose with slack, lips too large for the space they were given. When she spoke, her teeth were a chaotic jumble.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Are you prepared?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben nodded mutely, staring in horrified wonder. What had he gotten himself into?
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The door opened next to them and a guard stared out. &#x201C;Officer Goodwin?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Heather turned toward him. &#x201C;Speaking.&#x201D; She glanced over her shoulder. &#x201C;Follow closely.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben went numbly, staying as far behind as he could without looking suspicious.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And although he barely knew whose side he was on anymore, he was sure the two of them were stepping behind enemy lines.
			</p>

			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

				&#x201C;Yeah, it really is. Now be quiet and wait for your slime cube like a good prisoner.&#x201D;

				Amelia dragged herself awake, the voices flowing from her dreams into reality so smoothly that at first she didn&#x2019;t notice she&#x2019;d even been asleep.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not waiting for prison food! I&#x2019;m getting out of here, and you can stay and rot for all I care.&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I have a good thing going with the guards. A <em>really</em> good one with Frank, and he&#x2019;s the one coming today. Can you get that through the blob of angst you call a brain, or do I need to spell it out for you? <em>Don&#x2019;t mess this up.</em>&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Kate scoffed. &#x201C;Waiting for your slime and making friends with the guards. You&#x2019;re pathetic.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Good morning to you too,&#x201D; Amelia muttered, sitting up off the concrete and groaning at just how much of her was sore. &#x201C;How long has it been?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Who knows,&#x201D; Kate spat. &#x201C;What makes you think we can keep track of time?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Two hours,&#x201D; Charlie said dully. &#x201C;About. Almost time for dinner.&#x201D; He cleared his throat. &#x201C;Glad to hear you&#x2019;re still with us. You know you talk like a damn horse in your sleep?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia laughed weakly. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s come up. What&#x2019;d I say?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Eh. It&#x2019;s like prophecies &mdash; I&#x2019;m sure it was all relevant, but none of it made sense.&#x201D; He cleared his throat. &#x201C;Seriously, though. Are you doing okay?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia shrugged and wished he could see it, so that she wouldn&#x2019;t have to speak. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201D; she managed, after a long enough pause it felt detached. She felt detached.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;How much longer?&#x201D; Kate asked.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Am I a stopwatch now?&#x201D; Charlie laughed roughly. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. Five minutes? Fifteen? <em>Soon</em>. What does it even matter? You&#x2019;re gonna have to wait either way.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Kate grumbled something unintelligible, and the conversation lapsed for a moment before she picked up again. &#x201C;Amelia, the plan is we find something to block the tray with when this Frank guy tries try to push it under the door, and when he bends down to get it out of the way, we grab his arm and hold it until he opens the door.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;What if he doesn&#x2019;t give us any food or just calls for backup? Why wouldn&#x2019;t he just shoot us as soon as he opens the door?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Do you have a better idea?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia gave it a few moments&#x2019; thought. &#x201C;Nope.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Then this is what we&#x2019;re doing.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;<em>We</em> aren&#x2019;t doing anything,&#x201D; Amelia said, actually managing to laugh a little. &#x201C;You can wrestle a guard if you want, but I&#x2019;m not helping.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;We need to be completely agreed on this. If this guard sees the slightest bit of doubt, he&#x2019;ll know he can beat us. We can&#x2019;t ever let him feel confidence &mdash; remember what Melissa taught us? Besides, it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you want to or not. I&#x2019;m Acting Sergeant, and I order you to help.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Are you &mdash; you&#x2019;re <em>actually</em> serious, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; Amelia got to her feet, her muscles unstable. &#x201C;Just &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;ve been around longer and you can do more pushups doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re better than us.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;That&#x2019;s all a military is, you know.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Whatever. I&#x2019;m not taking orders&mdash;&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She stopped short at the sound of a distant door opening. The lights clicked on, and for the first time, she could see, if barely. There was a clamor that resounded through the hall, like an audience getting up and moving around after a prolonged silence. Over the text five minutes, the movement and conversation was replaced by the sounds of frantic eating as the guard made his way down toward them.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; Kate muttered. &#x201C;You better be ready.&#x201D;

				A parade of guards carrying huge sheets of metal and boxes of tools filed past, each snapping off a salute, and Coles held up a hand. &#x201C;One moment.&#x201D; He looked them over. &#x201C;What are you going to do?&#x201D;
			</p>

		<br>

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You consider no consequence that does not affect you,&#x201D; Heather said flatly. &#x201C;If our targets are in this location, we must gain custody of them before they incite an uprising.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Coles blinked. &#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;m afraid anyone not registered with the prison can&#x2019;t see the actual cells, let alone take prisoners out. I mean, they&#x2019;re in there for a reason.&#x201D;

			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Very well.&#x201D; They rounded a corner, and doors to a stairwell and the barracks came into view. They entered into the latter. &#x201C;I must verify that these prisoners are safely contained, if nothing more is possible. Could you determine this for me and return?&#x201D;

				Amelia took the opportunity to look herself over in the small light from the hallway. She was thinner than she&#x2019;d been in years, though with a fair bit more muscle &mdash; and her hands were a blistered catastrophe when she glanced under the scarves &mdash; but otherwise, she was fine. It was remarkable how well she was holding up, physically.

She was sitting against the opposite wall, watching the window in the door as if she couldn&#x2019;t just see the ceiling through it. Travis stood leaned against the back wall, away from the door, chewing on his bottom lip in thought. He still hadn&#x2019;t said anything, and Kate hadn&#x2019;t asked him. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t tell if he was with her or not.

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Kate stood and stepped over to the door, ducking under the window. She placed the shoe so that it half-occluded the slot in the bottom, held it in place, and waited, crouched down.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia could see Frank through the window now, a lanky, red-haired man wheeling a massive cart stacked with food. He was ten cells away. Then nine. Eight. Seven&mdash;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Something started ringing. The sound of it startled Amelia enough that she jumped a little, and the entire cell block fell silent as Frank produced a tiny phone and flipped it open.

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie whistled under his breath in the next cell over. &#x201C;That thing must have some damn good range if it can go through eight floors without a satellite.&#x201D; Amelia almost shushed him, but he trailed off as Frank started to speak.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Lieutenant Cortéz speaking.&#x201D;

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia was surprised to hear the other side of the conversation almost as well &mdash; there was no other noise in the room, and Frank wasn&#x2019;t that far away. &#x201C;Yeah, man, it&#x2019;s Casey. Listen, I need a favor.&#x201D;
			</p>

			<p class="body-text">

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">

			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;To check on the prisoners in cell 67.&#x201D;

		<br>

			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;What, does she want to take them out or something?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, maybe? She asked to, but I told her she couldn&#x2019;t even go up there. Now she just wants to know how they are.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Frank left the cart behind and started walking toward them. Amelia gestured Kate frantically back from the door, but she just got a glare in response. The guard glanced in, examined Amelia and Travis, furrowed his brow, and then looked straight down and found Kate, clutching a shoe next to the food slot. He raised an eyebrow but left them alone. &#x201C;Yeah, they&#x2019;re good.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No, I <em>know</em> they&#x2019;re good, but she won&#x2019;t take my word for it. She&#x2019;s insisting on talking to someone who&#x2019;s seen them in person.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">

		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

Tell you what &mdash; I&#x2019;ll even leave the lights on &#x2019;til I get back.&#x201D; And with that, he was gone.

				Casey Coles tapped his foot nervously &mdash; this was taking much too long. The policewoman had demanded a private room to talk to Frank, so they were now inside a storage closet while Casey waited outside. And waited, and waited, and waited. What could they possibly be doing? He almost put his ear to the door again, but barely stopped himself. If someone caught him, he&#x2019;d be out in the cold without a word in edgewise.

		<br>

			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;<em>Jesus,</em> Frank, what happened?&#x201D; Charlie saw them clearly first, closer to the door, but they came into Amelia&#x2019;s view after a moment. The smaller one had a disgusting mustache and a hood drawn up, hiding his dimly-lit features, but the tall one &mdash; Frank &mdash; was on display.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The short red hair was there in places, but most of it was black and long. He was far too small for his clothing, and it bunched up everywhere like a clown&#x2019;s. But his skin was the real terror &mdash; it was covered in gashes, as though it had been torn apart, and all of it bled freely. His nose was a broken mess, his mouth an open sore, and one of his eyes had fallen forward out of his head, held on by a cord of flesh and staring down at the floor.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Where are they?&#x201D; he asked, his voice nothing like what it had been. His voice modulated in speed and pitch during every word, and it sounded like he could barely speak English &mdash; or anything. His mouth was filled with blood, and some dribbled out as he spoke.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				To Amelia&#x2019;s horror, the mustached one pointed straight at her face in the window. Frank moved over with surprising grace, produced a set of keys, and unlocked the door, and Amelia joined Kate and Travis in cowering at the back of the room.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Heather &mdash; what do you think you&#x2019;re doing? Get out of there.&#x201D; The mustached figure pushed Frank aside and stood in his place, a slightly less intimidating figure. He threw back his hood, and Amelia could only stare. &#x201C;<em>Ben?</em>&#x201D;

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Can someone tell me what the hell is going on?&#x201D; Charlie yelled, and only then did Amelia hear the cacophony that was the cell block. It was a dozen times as loud as when she and Kate and Travis had tried to rescue Nate &mdash; everyone with a voice was using all of it to scream for help.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I require additional energy,&#x201D; Frank gurgled. He glanced at the food cart, still parked a few cells away. &#x201C;This will suffice.&#x201D; He walked liquidly over to it, unwrapped one of the cubes Charlie had talked about &mdash; a white, slimy-looking thing about half a foot to an edge &mdash; and shoved it in his mouth, swallowing immediately. Even Nate couldn&#x2019;t eat that fast. Half a dozen more cubes followed, more than any stomach could possibly hold.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				By then, Kate and Travis had come tentatively out of the cell. Kate looked from Ben&#x2019;s mustache to the mangled prison guard gorging on slime. &#x201C;What the <em>hell</em>, Ben?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Frank stopped eating and abruptly began to walked back toward them. As the five of them watched, his hair drooped, red and black alike, and fell to the floor, replaced quickly with a dull blonde. He picked up his dangling eye and placed it back in its socket, which held it as the bones around it shifted. The other bones in his face moved too, changing his appearance from a soft-faced man to a gaunt woman. He &mdash; <em>she</em> &mdash; bled profusely the entire time, and it was only at the end that the wounds closed up, scared over, and faded into the rest of her skin, invisible.

				His gaze fell on Amelia, and he walked over to wrap her in a hug, grinning. It was the first time she&#x2019;d seen him, and although he was gaunt and his beard and hair were twice as long, he didn&#x2019;t look too much the worse for wear.
