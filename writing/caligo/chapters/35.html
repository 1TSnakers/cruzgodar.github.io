				She had to save someone.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She had to save someone, and she couldn&#x2019;t remember who.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				The world was spiraling around her in browns and purples as if she were oxygen-deprived, and she wasn&#x2019;t even sure she was standing on solid ground.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				But she had to save someone. Garbled names and bits of faces flashed into focus and were gone just as fast, and none of them was who she wanted. All she could do was drift, tumbling and turning through the void and hoping she remembered.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				There was a gun in her hand. How long had that been there? She recalled with a dim lurch that she stole it. A ballistic gun, all hers. What use could she possibly have for a gun? Or &mdash; but, no, it wasn&#x2019;t hers. She was just the courier, just the go-between. That was good. She didn&#x2019;t want the stomach-clenching fear that came with holding it, not if she didn&#x2019;t have a good reason.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She turned around in the ether to head back home, but she wasn&#x2019;t quite sure where that was. Before she could think, though, the wisps of her attention were snagged by the soldiers in front of her, and the massive machine guns they held like staves, every one as tall as her. She couldn&#x2019;t even find it in her to hold the pistol up at them &mdash; it was hopeless. They lifted their guns as one, a firing squad that stretched to infinity in both directions, and she closed her eyes.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And felt the bullets ripping through her, tearing her limb from limb until long after she was sure it could go on no longer.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				<em>Click.</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia opened her eyes hesitantly, nearly blinded by the light. She was firmly on two feet and warmer than she thought possible. In her hands was a timecard, freshly punched, and she stared at it with the same confusion she&#x2019;d given the gun.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Slowly, she turned around to stare through a doorway and beyond a counter into a tiny dining area, speckled with empty chairs and wrapped in aging walls with windows too bright to see out of. She stepped through and rested her hands on the counter, watching the door. It was perfectly serene.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And silent. No one else was in the building, and though the drop of loneliness that fell dissolved quickly into the ambient, she could still feel it, and it would only grow if she waited.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				But the peace of the place held her. She closed her eyes again and smiled, breathing in the warmth.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				But her smile twitched, shook, and faltered. Something nagged at her mind, and as she focused closer on it, she felt the horrifying dread of opening a basement door in the dark of night. She became aware of the buzzing of flies, then the shouting of coworkers, then the demands of customers. She squeezed her eyes tighter, trying not to hear it, and for a while that worked, but what was left was even worse. The silence, the emptiness, the lonely uniformity stretching ahead for miles, it <em>ate</em> at her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Until at last, her eyes opened practically on their own.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Someone was staring at her from across the counter, examining her, much too close for comfort. Amelia&#x2019;s eyes widened immediately, and she tried to step backward, but her back was pressed up against something soft. She thrashed and tried to push the man away, and he moved back, out of her reach and not so threatening.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Amelia. Amelia, can you hear me?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She stopped the violent motions, slowly, and squinted at the man. His face was a little familiar, silhouetted against the glowing windows, but it was blurry and dim in her memory. She thought about saying something and decided against it, just nodding.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Good. You stay right there. I&#x2019;ll bring some friends.&#x201D; He disappeared, walking up the stairs in the corner. Had there always been stairs over there? She couldn&#x2019;t quite remember.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You really can&#x2019;t take a hint.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia leaned back against the soft wall behind the counter and glanced over at the hospital bed next to her. A woman was propped up in it, flipping through a newspaper. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t see her face clearly.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Why are you here?&#x201D; she asked. &#x201C;Shouldn&#x2019;t you be in a hospital?&#x201D; Her words came out jumbled and slurred.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let him catch you saying that.&#x201D; She chuckled darkly. &#x201C;God, you&#x2019;re <em>really</em> out of it, aren&#x2019;t you? Must be a hell of a story if you&#x2019;re on that many meds.&#x201D; She turned toward Amelia. &#x201C;So? What happened?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				And Amelia recognized her, and the warm interior of the pastry shop dissolved around Margaret&#x2019;s face. When she looked back toward the stairs, it was gone completely, replaced by concrete walls racked with medical tools.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Footsteps sounded, and Damien reentered the room, followed by Charlie, Ben, Heather, and Nate, the last one looking meek and thoroughly out of place.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				For a long moment, no one spoke. Then Charlie gave Nate a gentle push, and he approached the bed cautiously. Amelia hugged him tight as best she was able, and for a long while they stayed that way, neither of them making a sound. Nate didn&#x2019;t even cry. When he finally let go and stepped back to the others, she finally felt completely awake.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;How long?&#x201D; she asked Damien. Her voice was still a croak.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;About eight hours. That&#x2019;s not bad for what happened to you.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;And what was that?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He took a breath. &#x201C;You were lucky. Luckier than you had any right to be. You were shot in your left calf, but the bullet didn&#x2019;t hit bone.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Damien trailed off at the end, and it was clear he was leaving something out. &#x201C;But?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;But it nicked an artery. You were bleeding like crazy, and if it wasn&#x2019;t for this one&#x201D; &mdash; he gestured at Heather &mdash; &#x201C;you would have died. She tied the tightest bandage on you that I&#x2019;ve ever seen, and she knew exactly who I was. Got here in half an hour.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia shook her head slowly. &#x201C;No way she did. It&#x2019;s a lot longer than that.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie cleared his throat. &#x201C;She gave us directions and ran ahead. Could win the Olympics with that speed.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;If that bullet had been a millimeter to the left,&#x201D; Damien went on, &#x201C;you&#x2019;d have had a hole in your artery, and I don&#x2019;t have anything here to patch something like that up. I&#x2019;d have had to amputate half your leg. You probably still would have died.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia nodded absently, a little more aware of the dull pain in her calf. &#x201C;Is it good now?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Very good. But you won&#x2019;t be walking for quite a while.&#x201D; He glanced at her hands. &#x201C;You had some serious burns, too &mdash; you know those can get infected if you&#x2019;re not careful, right?&#x201D; He shook his head again. &#x201C;You should never have gotten involved in whatever this is. You&#x2019;re lucky to be alive.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She mouthed the words after him. They didn&#x2019;t make her afraid &mdash; didn&#x2019;t make her much of anything.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Amelia. Do you understand what happened?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D; She snapped her gaze back. &#x201C;Yeah, I understand.&#x201D; She looked past him at the other four. Heather was a statue and Nate had interested himself in the swaths of tools on the walls, but Ben and Charlie were shifting nervously, unable to stand still. She caught their attention. &#x201C;Got something to say?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie cleared his throat. &#x201C;Yeah, I guess we do. Uh, doc, you think you could take the kid upstairs? We need to talk alone.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Nate rounded on them. &#x201C;This is <em>ridiculous</em>. I deserve to know what the big secret is.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia furrowed her brow and glanced between the two of them. &#x201C;Uh, okay. Nate, go with Damien for now, and we&#x2019;ll catch up later. I just need to hear what these guys have to say first.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;<em>So do I.</em> Ugh, <em>fine</em>.&#x201D; He stepped away from the bed. &#x201C;Just tell me what they tell you, okay?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia nodded hesitantly. Damien gave a few instructions to her &mdash; don&#x2019;t turn over, don&#x2019;t mess with the IV, absolutely don&#x2019;t try to walk &mdash; before leading Nate over to the stairs.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Hey doc,&#x201D; Charlie murmured, catching Damien&#x2019;s attention. He nodded slightly at Margaret, who raised her hands in disbelief.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I can <em>see</em> you.&#x201D; She crossed her arms and glowered at him.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Damien frowned. &#x201C;Look. I can respect that you want privacy, but neither one of these two is moving for a <em>long</em> time. Either Margaret hears what you have to say or you don&#x2019;t say it.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben looked sick, and Charlie grunted. &#x201C;Fine. If she&#x2019;s bedridden anyway, it shouldn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Excuse you. I&#x2019;m getting damn close to walking again.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Heather spoke up before anyone else could. &#x201C;Do you receive visitors?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;More than the little arsonist over there has.&#x201D; That earned Amelia some weird glances, but no one paused to ask.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; Heather said. &#x201C;If you communicate the information we will discuss to a person not currently in this room, I will neutralize them before they are able to leave.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Whoa no no no!&#x201D; Damien rushed back down the stairs and stood in front of Heather. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t threaten my patients! Who do you think you are?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No threats were made against patients in this establishment.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie gave a nervous laugh. &#x201C;I think what she means is that we&#x2019;d just like our conversation to be private. No violence necessary.&#x201D; He grinned nervously at Damien and Margaret. &#x201C;Think we can roll with that?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				It took a little more convincing, but in the end, Damien took Nate back upstairs and Margaret lay back with her eyes closed and her arms crossed, a begrudged courtesy. By now Amelia was sitting up straight. She had no idea what to expect.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				But nobody said a thing. Even Heather looked unsure of how to begin.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia asked the question on the top of her mind. &#x201C;Do you know if Kate and Travis made it back safely?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie barked a laugh, but stifled it with a cough. &#x201C;Yeah. Uh, that&#x2019;s kinda where we need to begin anyway. So...&#x201D; He looked at Ben and Heather, clearly willing one of them to talk, and when neither one did, he sighed and kept going. &#x201C;So. Did you know the doc here is really interested in the Resistance?&#x201D; Amelia shook her head, and he went on. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s like a news source for the people out here. Spends his spare time collecting rumors from his patients that <em>they</em> got from citizens they met on the street. Sometimes he gets lucky and meets those citizens firsthand. Sometimes he&#x2019;s <em>really</em> lucky and they&#x2019;re Resistance.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Okay. So?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;So he knows that Kate and her... very supportive friend made it back in one piece with the gun.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia nodded. &#x201C;Great.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Right, well, maybe not so great. You got something to hold onto?&#x201D; She glared at him, and he just gestured at Ben. &#x201C;This one here&#x2019;s got some crazy theories about what&#x2019;s really happening.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia frowned at Ben. &#x201C;Is this what you were trying to tell Kate?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				He swallowed and fiddled with some kind of device in his hand. &#x201C;Yes. It&#x2019;s &mdash; well, it&#x2019;s...&#x201D; Ben looked at Charlie, who jutted his head back at him in defiance.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;The Resistance and government are in cooperation,&#x201D; Heather said simply, not so much as looking at the others.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Margaret&#x2019;s eyes shot open and she sat up to look at all of them, but Amelia barely noticed. &#x201C;Like, what, a peace deal or something?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Uh, no, not really,&#x201D; Charlie said hesitantly. Ben wouldn&#x2019;t meet her eyes. &#x201C;More like they were corrupt from the get-go.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben pressed a button on whatever it was that he held, and Vogel&#x2019;s voice crackled out from it, unmistakable.

				Amelia glanced between the three of them, Ben looking like he was at a funeral, Charlie as if he were on hot coals, and Heather as though she had fallen asleep standing up with her eyes open. And Amelia laughed, really laughed, for the first time in days, because it was just such a <em>hilarious</em> idea. The Resistance, the secret underground organization plotting to take over the government for years, secretly in league with the very thing they were trying to overthrow. It was ridiculous. She laughed for what felt like minutes &mdash; every time the humor began to dwindle, she&#x2019;d remember why she was laughing again and fall back into it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				She laughed so hard all the pain and heartbreak and stress of the weeks before melted away. So hard that her lungs began to hurt, and something else near them too.

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Right, so if she&#x2019;s working with Mayor Emerson, who absolutely doesn&#x2019;t want the outliers inside, then there would have to be a reason for it.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t think she actually wants all of them to come in?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t. We talked to Damien, and in the six years the Resistance has been around, they&#x2019;ve made two trips out here to help the outliers. <em>Two</em>. Don&#x2019;t you think they would be doing something more if Vogel wanted them to?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia chewed her bottom lip. &#x201C;Maybe she&#x2019;s under the mayor&#x2019;s control. Maybe she just can&#x2019;t do what she wants to.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Ben nodded. &#x201C;Okay, but then why wait so long? The mayor hasn&#x2019;t lifted a finger against the Resistance. The biggest thing she&#x2019;s done is this power outage, and I don&#x2019;t even know what that&#x2019;s accomplished.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Could&#x2019;ve been trying to incite some panic,&#x201D; Charlie murmured. &#x201C;Give some urgency.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Maybe. The point is that she could have arrested or jailed or killed the Resistance members at any time and gotten rid of a major threat. And she didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;So...&#x201D; Amelia rubbed her head. &#x201C;So Vogel is the one controlling Emerson.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so. Otherwise Vogel could have just forced her to step down or rig an election or something. And it doesn&#x2019;t explain the gun.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Okay?&#x201D; Amelia was out of options. &#x201C;So what do you think is actually going on?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;I think Vogel wants support. I think she wants to make it seem like she&#x2019;s taking over when she&#x2019;s actually just taking Emerson&#x2019;s place. If she&#x2019;s backed by everyone who hated the old mayor, then she can keep power without seeming like a monarch. A revolution where the leader is chosen by the agency being overthrown isn&#x2019;t that uncommon in history.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia felt empty. Everything she&#x2019;d worked at for months was decaying around her.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;But!&#x201D; Ben was getting excited now. &#x201C;That <em>still</em> doesn&#x2019;t explain why Emerson&#x2019;s going along. No counterstrikes, no complaints. Nothing. That&#x2019;s what I couldn&#x2019;t understand, until I talked it through with Charlie.&#x201D; He looked up at the old man expectantly.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;The strike&#x2019;s in a week,&#x201D; Charlie told Amelia slowly. &#x201C;It used to be in six months, and now it&#x2019;s in a week. What major event happens a week from now?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia blinked, thinking, and eventually shook her head tiredly. &#x201C;The train,&#x201D; she murmured. &#x201C;The train departs in a week.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Emerson <em>wants</em> this,&#x201D; Ben said. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s old and tired. She plans to take the train to York and leave Vogel as her unofficial successor. It&#x2019;s a win-win.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Not for all of you,&#x201D; Margaret muttered. &#x201C;You get all the mess of a revolution and none of the change.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Amelia rubbed her face in desperation. &#x201C;We could still get some change. She has to at least act like who she&#x2019;s promising to be, right?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Maybe.&#x201D; Charlie shrugged. &#x201C;Maybe not. All she really needs to do is not be worse than Emerson. That&#x2019;s not a high bar.&#x201D; He nodded at Heather. &#x201C;Plus, Marie Curie over here has an alternate theory.&#x201D; He grinned. &#x201C;Is that not the perfect nickname?&#x201D;

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;She was being shitty on purpose,&#x201D; Charlie explained. &#x201C;Cooperating with Vogel to make us all hate her more.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;So, what, we should just forgive Tabitha?&#x201D; Amelia spat. &#x201C;This is still half her fault. At least.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie squinted at her. &#x201C;No one&#x2019;s talking about forgiving her. But right now, I think it makes sense for our primary target to be Vogel.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Of course, girl! If we wait until she&#x2019;s in power, we won&#x2019;t have a chance.&#x201D;

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; Amelia blinked and leaned back, lightheaded. It was all too much to handle. &#x201C;So... what are you thinking? Do we contact Kate and Travis somehow?&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				Charlie and Ben exchanged glances. &#x201C;Kate and Travis are locked up, according to Damien. Word got out <em>very</em> fast.&#x201D;

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;Probably because she was afraid they&#x2019;d talked to me,&#x201D; Ben muttered. &#x201C;Apparently that&#x2019;s enough of a risk that she&#x2019;d rather have the whole Resistance talking about where they went.&#x201D;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">
			<p class="body-text">
				&#x201C;So we don&#x2019;t have people on the inside anymore, but Kate never would have believed this anyway.&#x201D; Charlie shrugged. &#x201C;You ask me, it&#x2019;ll be easier without her. Now, you wanna hear the plans we&#x2019;ve come up with?&#x201D;

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

		<br>

		<div data-aos="fade-up">

				&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; he said, still looking skeptical. &#x201C;Then I won&#x2019;t stop you.&#x201D; He turned and left up the stairs, and Amelia stared at them after he had left.
