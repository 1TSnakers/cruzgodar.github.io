Ben fumbled for the old clock and eventually got it to shut up, but only when he was much too awake to fall back asleep.</p><p class="body-text">The standard morning routine followed, but today it was different &mdash; today was the day he was going outside.</p><p class="body-text">It had taken him a week to work up the courage. He&#x2019;d practiced his speech a hundred times in his head until it was polished to a shine, and now all he had to do was convince Mr. Lipcott to let him go. Then he&#x2019;d be free for all of two hours &mdash; more than enough to find that bookstore and come back. Ben took a long breath, trying to calm his nerves &mdash; he was already jumpier than a cat over water.</p><p class="body-text">That jumpiness didn&#x2019;t help him play the cello. At all. By the end of the two hours, Mrs. Delvy was openly glaring at him, and Ben was happy to see her go. When Mr. Lipcott entered the room, his adrenaline only spiked more, and he was about ready to panic then and there.</p><p class="body-text">Mr. Lipcott looked up and smiled his usual smile. &#x201C;Hi, Ben.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">It had to be now. Every day he had four classes &mdash; this year those were cello, history, English, and Norwegian &mdash; with a gap in the middle for lunch and Richard&#x2019;s instruction. If any teacher was going to cover for him, it would be this one.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Mr. Lipcott?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; The man looked placidly at him.</p><p class="body-text"><em>Start off strong.</em> That was at the foundation of what Richard had taught him &mdash; always make the first move, putting your opponent on the defensive from the start. &#x201C;I was thinking...&#x201D; All his doubts surfaced immediately &mdash; what <em>was</em> he thinking? This was going to be a disaster.</p><p class="body-text">Mr. Lipcott waited patiently for him to finish, though Ben had already lost most of his little confidence. &#x201C;I was thinking that I&#x2019;d go for a walk today. Around the city.&#x201D; He swallowed. &#x201C;Alone.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Mr. Lipcott looked at him for a moment before he spoke, a few short-lived expressions playing out across his face. Ben watched them all carefully. There was no confusion, which made him a little confused himself, but instead a small bit of understanding wrapped in much more of something else. Sadness? No. Pity.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;Of course, Ben. You&#x2019;re welcome to go wherever you&#x2019;d like. I&#x2019;ll wait here for the two hours and then I&#x2019;ll head out &mdash; does that sound good?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben let out a tensely held breath.&#x201D;Yeah. Yes, I mean<em>.</em> That sounds great.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">Ben walked to the stairwell with purpose, his heart trying to kill him, and up to Richard&#x2019;s floor. He was in his office in the Watchtower, but the sight of the double doors looming over Ben from the other end of the narrow hallway was fear enough for his liking.</p><p class="body-text">He turned into one of the side rooms and shut the door softly behind him, took a deep breath to calm down &mdash; for all the good it did &mdash; and glanced around at the lights and wires that surrounded him. The bulb overhead was already on &mdash; not a single one in the Golden Crown ever shut off.</p><p class="body-text">It was a simple enough task, but his nerves kept getting in the way. Ben flipped through the security cameras, overriding eight of them to show static images of their usual view with no one in the room. The footage wouldn&#x2019;t show a thing when Ben passed by the cameras on his way out.</p><p class="body-text">He locked the system with the password he&#x2019;d set as soon as Richard had given him the old one, then left the room quietly, closing the door behind him and wincing when it clicked. And then, when he was sure no one could see, Ben bolted, walking as fast as he thought he could get away with. Down the stairs, past stores, restaurants, and so many slot machines, he made his way to the back door, and he almost didn&#x2019;t believe it when he pushed it open into an alley and no one tried to stop him. It swung back behind him and locked automatically, but he wasn&#x2019;t worried &mdash; Richard had made sure his son had a key, if only so that he could get inside if he were ever kidnapped.</p><p class="body-text">He stood out in the alley for a long moment, taking deep breaths of air laced with the smells of cheap food and smog, before he remembered he was on a tight schedule.</p><p class="body-text">Ben didn&#x2019;t know if his father had people watching him and making sure he attended all his classes, but he wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised. He <em>did</em> know that he had a perfect track record, though &mdash; in the six years he&#x2019;d been alone with Richard, Ben had never attempted anything close to this &mdash; and it was largely that thought that had given him the courage to leave.</p><p class="body-text">He stepped out of the alley into the blinding sunlight, and it washed away any residual fears. The throngs of people outside were so huge that it would have been hard not to slip in unnoticed, and Ben found himself squashed between two women, one wearing a suit and a concealed rubigun, the other looking exhausted and burdened with five shopping bags. He did his best to move with the human flow, almost getting trampled more than once.</p><p class="body-text">It was ten minutes before he remembered that he hadn&#x2019;t intended to just walk the streets &mdash; he had a wad of bills in his bag, about five hundred thousand in total. It didn&#x2019;t occur to him for another half an hour that someone might try to lift it off him, but he was lucky for that half-hour, moving unscathed. By then, he was out of the heart of Los Angeles, and the crowds were thinning, if only slightly. He veered off to the side and ducked into a neon-streaked establishment, advertising burgers and fries at all-you-can-eat prices.</p><p class="body-text">He&#x2019;d seen fast food before, but from a distance at best &mdash; no chaperone would dare bring him near that garbage. Ben thought that was perfectly fine, but he wasn&#x2019;t about to get another chance to try the garbage for himself. He stepped up to the front, and the cashier didn&#x2019;t so much as look at him after helping his current customer. Ben cleared his throat, and the employee, barely older than he was, gave him a glance. &#x201C;Back of the line, bud.&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben cleared his throat. &#x201C;You must not understand. I&#x2019;m&mdash;&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">An older woman shoved him bodily out of the way, and Ben just stared at her for a long moment before shuffling to the back of the line and keeping his head down.</p><p class="body-text">Everyone knew who Richard was. Everyone. He wasn&#x2019;t on the screens nearly as much as the mayor, but a month couldn&#x2019;t pass without him showing up to discuss the city&#x2019;s newest building, broadcasting live from the suite of cameras he kept locked in the same room as the security cameras &mdash; he liked to keep the things he didn&#x2019;t understand safely away from the rest of his life. Richard could walk into any restaurant in the city and leave a minute later with whatever he wanted. And as much as Ben knew it was for the best that no one recognized him, that didn&#x2019;t stop it from stinging.</p><p class="body-text">Eventually, waiting in line with the rest, Ben ordered himself what the board behind the cashier called a Square Meal. For the low price of five thousand dollars, he was handed a piece of meat sandwiched between two soggy buns, a box of potato bits that looked very little like potatoes at all, and a soda. He figured it was best not to stay &mdash; a few customers were still glaring at him &mdash; and so he left by the same door he&#x2019;d come in, stepping back out onto the crowded street. He looked for a bench for five or ten minutes, and eventually he was lucky enough to find one right as someone left it empty. The sun was straight overhead, and his near-translucent skin was suffering for it, but he stayed out anyway, devouring his food. After the first bite, he wondered why the chefs in the Golden Crown didn&#x2019;t make this stuff, and after the last bite, he understood. He wouldn&#x2019;t be going back any time soon.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">He finally managed to track down the bookstore fifteen minutes later. Books were only a part of its inventory, though &mdash; most of its shelves were stuffed with antiques, which were just pre-Umbra curiosities scavenged from the outside world, but Ben was still fascinated. Magazines, computers that wouldn&#x2019;t turn on, watches &mdash; some of which even still worked &mdash; and a single blue pocketknife sitting dusty on a shelf. Ben was drawn to that in particular, and when he picked it up, opening all of its blades and files and tweezers, he couldn&#x2019;t put it back down. He was ready to pay any price the owner asked, and though fifty thousand seemed a little high, he forked the money over gladly without the faintest clue of how to haggle.</p><p class="body-text">He moved over to the assortment of books for sale, and eventually left after twenty minutes with five thousand dollars and what felt like five thousand books in his bag. He&#x2019;d bought an encyclopedia from the nineties &mdash; though only the volumes up to C had been there &mdash; along with a history textbook that covered some of what Mr. Lipcott hadn&#x2019;t. He had also taken every one of the six adventure novels they had, and that was the real reason he&#x2019;d come out here &mdash; Richard was happy to buy him books, but only ones that contributed to his education, and so the shelf in his room had seen no new fiction in years. He hardly cared if these new books were terrible. They certainly hadn&#x2019;t been cheap, but at least he&#x2019;d had expected that. What he hadn&#x2019;t expected has the heft. Carrying thirty pounds of words on his shoulder had him panting in minutes, and when he checked his watch and saw that he had a little over half an hour left, he tried unsuccessfully to double his pace. He knew it would be his only time out, but he tried not to think about that. That, or the small voice of defiance that never seemed to leave his subconscious, rationalizing, longing, and convincing by turns.</p><p class="body-text">Ben hardly knew it was there.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">He moved from building to building, as eager as a dog sniffing out food. He&#x2019;d told himself his second time out would be his last, no more sneaking around, no more taking advantage of Mr. Lipcott, no more fun.</p><p class="body-text">Now he was back out for the fourth time in two weeks, feeling guilty and excited and maybe just a little bit happy. This time he was bringing back a few trinkets and a wildly expensive book that claimed to be an account of Umbra. Ben had been two at the time, and he remembered nothing of either the old world adults sometimes spoke of or the blackout itself. A scientific, detailed description of the event piqued his interest, even if no one really knew why it had happened. There were hundreds of explanations by now, every one as ludicrous as the idea of the sun disappearing in the first place &mdash; it quantum tunneled somewhere else, it was still there and just wrapped in a heat-blocking black substance, aliens took it. Nearly every theory involved the government, since they&#x2019;d begun feverishly constructing the dome a year before it was needed with no explanation ever given.</p><p class="body-text">Ben had hoped when Richard hired Mr. Lipcott, two years ago, that the teacher would talk about the causes of Umbra, or at least the effects. Neither had happened &mdash; Ben couldn&#x2019;t get the man to speak of the event at all, only life long before. Mr. Lipcott said that it wasn&#x2019;t history if it wasn&#x2019;t at least twenty-five years old, but Ben doubted another eleven years would change anything.</p><p class="body-text">So he&#x2019;d turned to books. They&#x2019;d taught him about York, the Chicago Collapse, and of course, about Umbra. But there was maddeningly little about the latter available, and every book written after Umbra that Ben could find was unedited, close to a first draft, riddled with typos, and written on typewriters more often than not. Most were just conspiratorial garbage.</p><p class="body-text">Ben wasn&#x2019;t interested in why Umbra happened so much as what had happened because of it &mdash; how the cities were constructed, why only two survived, if there were more in other countries. There were so many gaps in his knowledge that he was sure he could patch with the right book, and the one he held now was the latest of many attempts to find it.</p><p class="body-text">He was almost back to the Golden Crown now. Getting in was just as easy as getting out &mdash; he wasn&#x2019;t even sure Richard knew about the key he had anymore. Ben let himself through the small back door into the stairwell and tried to muffle his footsteps on the hard stone as he ascended. The climb was an effort for him, and he was breathing hard by the third floor and sweating by the tenth, but it was safer to take the stairs than the elevator, where someone might see him who would sound the alarm.</p><p class="body-text">Up, past the lobby, past a bacchanalia of gambling spread over ten floors. Even in the early afternoon, there was a sizable number there, taking their forty-five percent odds with abandon. There weren&#x2019;t many laws on casinos anymore, and Richard skirted what few there were by being so close to the mayor herself.</p><p class="body-text">Then ten floors of food, of almost every ethnicity a rich gambler could want. Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Portuguese, Greek, Brazilian, Thai, American. These days the names meant little more than different kinds of things to eat. Ben grimaced and moved on.</p><p class="body-text">The last five floors were private &mdash; mostly offices, conference rooms, and the occasional service room. The twenty-fourth contained just a few, his room one of them. He made his way down the carpeted corridor, his steps now perfectly silent, and hid the book and pointless bobbles in his wardrobe, beneath his clothes. He had fifteen minutes to spare, and he flopped on his bed, happy to be out of the heat.</p><p class="body-text">It took Ben ten long seconds to understand what he was hearing, and even then, it still didn&#x2019;t make any sense.</p><p class="body-text">For all Richard that was technologically illiterate, his wife had been the opposite. She&#x2019;d showed Ben how to use computers of all kinds, and once she&#x2019;d even bought Ben a circuit kit, probably from an antique shop much like the ones he&#x2019;d been frequenting. He&#x2019;d fallen in love with it, even if half the wires didn&#x2019;t work.</p><p class="body-text">Years later, shortly after his mother left, Ben had been storming around his room looking for something to take his anger out on when he noticed a tiny plate on his wall half-hidden by his wardrobe. He unscrewed it to find a set of phone lines, and with nothing better to do, he had split one of the wires and fed it into the speaker from the old circuit kit. It all fit neatly back inside the wall.</p><p class="body-text">When he realized what Richard would do if he found out, Ben had sealed the plate back up in fear. It had never once made a noise, and eventually he assumed he just hadn&#x2019;t known what he was doing. And yet now it seemed he had.</p><p class="body-text">Ben put his ear to the wall, straining to make out words. The audio was full of static, and Ben could only hear Richard, not who he was talking to.</p><p class="body-text">&#x201C;...many million? Will... enough?&#x201D; Richard&#x2019;s voice was on the edge of Ben&#x2019;s hearing, and he couldn&#x2019;t make out many of the words. &#x201C;Too soon. When... leave?&#x201D; He paused, probably for the person on the other end to respond, then continued. &#x201C;...about... chemist?&#x201D;</p><p class="body-text">Ben&#x2019;s brow furrowed, but no explanation followed. The conversation went on a bit longer without him making out anything, and finally Richard said, &#x201C;Yes... of course... secure.&#x201D; The line went silent.</p><p class="body-text">Ben stepped away slowly and walked back to his bed, confused and just a little apprehensive. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been the first time Richard was involved in illicit business, if that was what was going on. But something in his father&#x2019;s hushed tone made him nervous, as if he were planning something.</p><p class="body-text">Maybe something big.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script src="/scripts/init.min.js"></script></body></html>
