She really didn't have time for this.

Amelia stepped down into the cellar that was Charlie's home. It hadn't been locked, maybe because the wood making up the doors wasn't fireproof --- if someone found the entrance under all the rags and tarps and wanted to get in, a lock wasn't going to stop them.

The stairs were steep and the ceiling low, and Amelia had to crouch to fit all the way inside. But once on the bottom, she found the room opened up, and the wood-paneled walls invited her in.

It was just large enough to not feel cramped --- ten feet wide and twenty deep, if that. There was a narrow bed taking up half of the left side and a table and desk occupying all of the right. Half a dozen chemical instruments rested on them, most of them empty. Amelia kept her distance.

Farther back, behind the bed, there was a tiny bookcase --- barely half her height. The top shelf held a few articles of ragged clothing, the bottom one books. Amelia glanced at the four titles and found nothing but dry literature that Ben would probably like, certainly nothing she would ever read.

As she approached the back wall, she realized there were no stairs into the building above. Maybe there had never been any to begin with, or maybe Charlie had paneled over them. From those panels, dimly visible in the light from the stairway, jutted two mahogany hooks, jutting out from the smooth wall. It was clear what was meant to go there.

Amelia gripped the staff tighter and grimaced. She couldn't bring herself to do it, even if it was the reason she'd come in the first place.

There was an unlit candle on the desk, melted down to almost nothing, and she was struck with the sudden urge to light the candle, close the doors, and stay inside as long as she could. But the light from the door was cold and sharp, and she was drawn to it like a moth.

Amelia gave one last look as she stepped out, before hiding the door behind her. She'd wasted two minutes, but there was never a choice.

Now there were no more stops. Nowhere else to go but the Watchtower. It was time to deal with Tabitha.

Vogel spoke about power, about freedom, about love, anger, and righteous justice. Even without loudspeakers, her voice carried far, and Charlie, through stone and wood, could make out all of it.

He breathed for a few moments, trying to let the adrenaline dissipate, before he got to work. The room was freakishly small, the white walls closing in on every side, and there was barely room for furniture.

It made sense to check the desk first. It was simple and elegant, and made of dark, well-varnished wood. And it was thin --- too thin to hold a gun, let alone any kind of drawer. Charlie spent half a minute trying to detach the legs to check for hidden compartments but got nowhere.

Then the chair. Charlie tore open the cushions, tugged and twisted at every joint, and did everything else short of smashing the thing on the ground. It was in tatters by the end, but those tatters hadn't held anything.

He heard cheers ring out from the crowd outside and swallowed. Vogel was still speaking, though, so he still had time.

Next, and last, were the filing cabinets. There was nothing else in the room. He opened the first of four drawers to find... nothing. It was perfectly empty, and so were the other three.

Charlie began to panic, even if he would never admit it. He pulled out every drawer, checking for false bottoms, hidden compartments in the frame itself, anything. When that failed, he pushed the cabinet out of the way to reveal nothing but more blank white wall.

So he paced around the sides of the room in a rush, pushing against every square foot of wall he could reach. Nothing moved. He moved to the floor, and it was when he was on his hands and knees, staring failure in the eyes, that he thought to look up. On the ceiling above the filing cabinet was a tiny square outline, barely visible.

Charlie let out a relieved sigh and climbed onto the cabinet. It was small, but he kept his footing easily, standing up almost straight and pushing on the square. The tile raised up, and Charlie felt around in the revealed space. His hand came back holding a cold metal weapon.

It was dark. Rubiguns were all painted a vibrant purple, and with their see-through clip for the charges, they looked like cheap water guns in comparison. What he held now was simple, brutal, and made to kill, not incapacitate.

It terrified him.

Charlie checked to make sure the safety was on and climbed carefully down from the cabinet. He took one more look, shoved the gun in his pocket, and turned around to see a guard, face hidden, holding a rubigun to his nose and staring straight at him. Before he could react, the guard spun the pistol, grabbed it by the barrel, and slammed the butt into his temple. Charlie's vision blurred and his consciousness fragmented, and he was out.
