# XVI: Making Connections

Ben leaned in, staring at his mug. &#x201C;I have something this time.&#x201D; He couldn&#x2019;t help but be a little proud.

&#x201C;That reassures.&#x201D; Heather was as invisible as last week, a shimmer in the seat across from him. If she had any coffee of her own, she wasn&#x2019;t showing.

&#x201C;My father talked with the mayor yesterday. They&#x2019;re not doing the power grid restructure to save energy, they&#x2019;re doing it to cut off power to the Resistance.&#x201D;

Heather was silent a long time, and Ben wished he could see her expression. &#x201C;What else?&#x201D; she said at last.

Ben blinked. Had she already known? &#x201C;Well, it sounds like he&#x2019;s in charge of building a new police headquarters. And he isn&#x2019;t actually going to build a geothermal plant. Mayor Emerson wanted to, but&mdash;&#x201D;

&#x201C;Millions will die,&#x201D; Heather replied instantly.

Ben frowned. &#x201C;Is it really that bad?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Millions will die.&#x201D;

Ben took a deep breath. Could Richard doom most of the population, knowingly or not? *Would* he? &#x201C;How do you know?&#x201D; he asked. One last chance.

&#x201C;I have extensively studied the effects of ambient temperature on solid materials.&#x201D;

Ben rubbed his face. It would be so much easier if he was just hearing voices.

*You wish to assist me in exposing him.* Did he really? What if he failed? What if Heather failed? And for that matter...

&#x201C;I think you&#x2019;re in danger.&#x201D;

&#x201C;I am perpetually in a degree of danger.&#x201D;

&#x201C;The mayor knows about you,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I think she might be trying to capture you.&#x201D; His brow furrowed. &#x201C;What have you been doing?&#x201D;

&#x201C;I have infiltrated several buildings within the past week.&#x201D; She said it matter-of-factly, as if talking herself up in a job interview.

&#x201C;You *what?*&#x201D; Ben tried to stare at her, but his gaze ended up down at the floor. &#x201C;*Why?*&#x201D; he hissed.

&#x201C;I required information. I retrieved the majority of what I sought.&#x201D;

&#x201C;And what was that?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Richard Parkington has invested forty-eight billion dollars into a private account over the past eight months. An unknown individual has been drawing out the funds slowly. There are memos that refer to a facility whose purpose is obfuscated. Parkington is listed as the project leader. He has never made any such project public.&#x201D;

&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the police headquarters.&#x201D;

&#x201C;That project is public and has been heavily publicized. The son of its director should be aware of such a fact.&#x201D;

Ben fought to keep the grimace off his face. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sticking my neck out for you. Don&#x2019;t forget that.&#x201D;

&#x201C;The headquarters is expected to consume fewer than five billion dollars. There is no plot of land for sale for which a forty-eight-billion-dollar building with median cost per volume would reach lower than the Watchtower.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Is that so,&#x201D; Ben said hollowly. He was beginning to wonder if he&#x2019;d ever really known his father.

&#x201C;There is still intelligence I do not possess. I require your help.&#x201D;

&#x201C;You... what?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Two things must be done. First, you will record Parkington&#x2019;s future conversations.&#x201D; Ben started when he felt something land in his lap, but Heather ignored him, continuing.

&#x201C;And we must enter your father&#x2019;s office in the Watchtower.&#x201D;



<p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p>



Ben was thankful diplomatic skills had been drilled into him, because he didn&#x2019;t listen to anything else Heather had to say. It was only when she bid him goodbye and he walked numbly back to the Golden Crown that bits and pieces began to filter back.

*I will provide cover.* She&#x2019;d said that at one point, he was pretty sure. He hadn&#x2019;t probed into it at the time, but Ben could only assume Heather meant she would make him invisible too.

Then what? Into the lobby, into the elevator, and into Richard&#x2019;s office. Somehow. And why? To uncover information on some &#x201C;facility&#x201D; he was supposedly involved in?

A day lurched by. What were they supposed to do with the information? Hand it to a newspaper and walk away? What was that supposed to accomplish? The public outcry, if there even was any, could pressure Richard into building the geothermal plant. Maybe.

Another day. Did he even want to try to uncover this? What if it went another way, and Richard couldn&#x2019;t go through with the power grid restructure? Then the Resistance would flourish. He couldn&#x2019;t let that happen.

Tuesday. What if he were caught? The thought of his father&#x2019;s wrath was a terrifying thing.

He came to a decision on Wednesday &mdash; he couldn&#x2019;t do it. The payoff was uncertain and the risk massive. He left his last class and grabbed a book off his shelf, taking it to the roof garden. He sat down on a bench and opened the novel, expecting relief and willing himself to focus, but neither came. Eventually he gave up and set the book down, gazing out over the city and looking for a little patch of green.

He couldn&#x2019;t find it.

Ben let out an involuntary sigh and walked back down into the building only to nearly run straight into Richard. The older man stopped, studying him carefully.

&#x201C;You finished your last class?&#x201D;

Ben nodded. Words always came a little too slowly.

&#x201C;How are your grades?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; Ben murmured.

&#x201C;Speak up.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; he said again, incrementally louder.

&#x201C;See that you keep them that way. I hear your last ethics class set your average on a negative trend.&#x201D; Ben didn&#x2019;t respond, and Richard&#x2019;s mouth twitched into a frown. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been talking to someone on your trips outside.&#x201D;

Ben&#x2019;s heart skipped several beats before he realized Richard was probably talking about someone visible. Hopefully. &#x201C;Yes?&#x201D; he squeaked.

&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t speak at a normal volume, I&#x2019;ll see that you never set foot outside this building again.&#x201D; Richard&#x2019;s eyes flashed for the slightest of moments before lying dormant again.

&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Ben managed, speaking almost as loud as he would around anyone else. &#x201C;Yes, I did see someone.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Listen to me carefully. That girl fits a mold that ninety-nine of every hundred share. She will take everything from you if you give her the chance. Now I&mdash;&#x201D; He grimaced. &#x201C;*Look* at me. Good. I can see in your eyes you think she&#x2019;s different, but it&#x2019;s only a matter of time. Even if it takes years. I can&#x2019;t&mdash;&#x201D; Richard stopped abruptly, swallowing. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t stop you from talking to her, but see that you don&#x2019;t give her a thing, or she&#x2019;ll follow you like a spoiled dog.&#x201D;

Richard sized him up, then nodded curtly and left. He strode swiftly to his office, unlocked the deadbolt, swung open the massive doors, and locked them behind him. Ben stared after him for a second or two, then walked slowly to his room, wishing his own door locked.

The city was gray, the rare green nowhere to be found.

The voices coming from the wall were a welcome distraction. He clicked on the recorder Heather had given him, knelt by the speaker, and pushed all thoughts of Amelia from his mind.

&#x201C;The restructure is reaching the Resistance as we speak.&#x201D; The rasp was all too familiar. &#x201C;The mayor&#x2019;s set to make her speech tomorrow morning.&#x201D; Ben pressed his ear to the panel and brought the recording device from Heather with him.

&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;ll be there. I&#x2019;ll propose a plant and she&#x2019;ll veto it and take the fall.&#x201D; Richard sounded as gruff as usual.

&#x201C;She told me. Look, you don&#x2019;t need to keep me informed &mdash; I&#x2019;m closer to Emerson than you&#x2019;ll ever be. You&#x2019;re the one who needs information here.&#x201D;

He *had* to know who could talk to his father like this. The connection was staticky enough to obfuscate much of the fine detail in the man&#x2019;s voice, but Ben knew he would recognize it if he&#x2019;d heard it before. If the mayor was talking to him directly, he had to be in government, but that was neither surprising nor specific.

Richard cleared his throat. &#x201C;Very well.&#x201D;

&#x201C;You&#x2019;re *sure* your prison guards have what we need?&#x201D;

&#x201C;I&#x2019;m certain of it.&#x201D;

&#x201C;You better be.&#x201D; The voice dropped into a growl. &#x201C;If you mess this up, I will make sure you lose *everything*. Do you understand?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; That quiet response again &mdash; Richard was scared.

&#x201C;Good.&#x201D; The line clicked.

*Your prison guards*. Ben couldn&#x2019;t shake the thought of the massive facility Heather had mentioned. Where else would he need guards? The unknown man could easily be the one drawing the funds out, too.

There was a simmer within him &mdash; it had been there for weeks, and now it was slowly becoming a boil. Ben couldn&#x2019;t take it any longer, couldn&#x2019;t sit and listen on phone lines to his father managing mysterious facilities and talking to a mysterious person and *controlling him*.

And when the alternative, the branch in the path, was right there waiting patiently to be taken, how could he possibly refuse?

Something had changed in him, and although he would make a show of thinking it over for the next three days, he&#x2019;d already decided. There was never even a choice.
