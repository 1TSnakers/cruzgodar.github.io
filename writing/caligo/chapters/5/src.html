Without Charlie's lessons, Amelia spent the weekend wandering the city streets and feeling more than a little aimless. Monday slid conspicuously in front of her, and she tried to go to work after practicing in the courtyard --- she really did. But when she got close enough to Ann's to look inside, all she could see was the greasy, dirty, dreary atmosphere, and all she could feel was a harsh repulsion. Lucas would call it laziness. It wasn't, but she couldn't explain that to him for reasons that were opaque to her, some mix of pride and privacy and annoyance. She told herself she'd be back before long, but she hadn't gone near the place two days later. Her free time often found her in Stonewall Park instead, and once, without even realizing she was going there, near a building with *Silver Dollar* stamped in massive red letters across its front.

Amelia walked home on Wednesday, pulling open the heavy door and stepping through into darkness and stale air. A sloppily-cut loaf of bread sat on the counter, the knife still next to it.

She moved slowly as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. "Nate?"

She got no response and stepped further into the room, finally reaching the light switch. No one was there, and so she poked her head into the closet of a bedroom to see her brother sprawled on the bed, his face in a pillow. Amelia walked to the side of the bed and gave him a gentle shake. "Still asleep?" she asked quietly.

"No." There wasn't a hint of tiredness in his voice. After a long moment, he sat up slowly, staring at the far wall.

"Okay," Amelia said slowly. "You wanna talk?" Nate just shrugged in response, and she fell silent again, waiting for him to say something. When he seemed content to just stay quiet, she pushed herself to her feet, wincing just a little at bruises and sore muscles, and made for the door.

"Tommy's gone."

Amelia stopped in mid-step. It took her half a minute to piece together what had happened, and when she finally did, she deflated with a long breath. She turned around slowly and sat back down next to the bed, drawing her knees close. "You told me how much he liked fruit."

He didn't say anything, still facing the wall, and Amelia stared too. "You tell Lucas?" Her brother shook his head in response, and her mind started spinning. He needed to get out of the house.

"How about we head up to Stonewall park? It's a beautiful day."

He turned that stare on her and squinted a little. "It's been nine days."

She swallowed. "I... I can't even imagine. It must be so hard."

"It---" Nate shook his head, his face knotted in an emotion she couldn't read. "Where have you been?"

Amelia blinked. "Where have I been? I don't---"

"Sure, let's go to Stonewall park. Tomorrow morning. How does that work for you?"

"Well, I have work tomorrow, and I thought I'd---"

"You don't have work tomorrow," Nate said, cutting her off. "But you do right now."



<p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p>



The walk was a long one. She thought of Nate whenever she started dragging her feet, and along with the idea of facing Lucas without a full paycheck, that was enough to make her go back to the pastry shop.

And there it was, the once-charming now-rundown shop that had the self-proclaimed "best Ã©clairs in LA". Amelia had tried them, years ago, and thought it was probably true. She opened the doors and parted the grease-laden air and made her way through the empty front, throwing on an apron and grabbing her name tag.

Except her name tag wasn't there to grab. She glanced around, but there was nowhere else it would be but on the board with the rest. And someone else was working the register? She turned to one of the other employees in the room, someone she'd known for years but barely spoken a dozen words with, and asked what was going on.

And that was how she found out she'd been fired on the first day she'd missed work.

If anyone had bothered to ask, she would have said she felt some mix of dread and guilt and shame, but that would have been a lie. For just a moment, before she thought of the consequences of the lack of paycheck or of the thought of facing Lucas, Amelia was relieved. More than relieved, even --- elated. She was finally out from a job she'd never wanted in the first place, she had more time for Charlie, and she felt free for the first time in a long while.

So she didn't protest her firing, just hung her apron back up and walked out the front door, head held high.

But waiting for her outside the greasy air was all that dread, and Amelia realized she had four days to come up with eighty thousand dollars. If not, she would be taking it from her savings, and her savings wouldn't last long.

But what else could she do? Maybe she could find a job in four days --- *maybe.* But even then, it wouldn't pay for another month, and she needed money *now.*

She laughed to herself under her breath. Lucas had felt the same way a long time ago, and everyone remembered that all too well.

That thought stuck in her mind, twisting into something else, and she stopped, backing up foot traffic. She got a few angry yells and shoves, but she was too busy thinking about a specific kind of revenge to notice. She'd hungered after it for years, and there was no doubt it would result in plenty of cash, even if that hadn't been her motivation before. She knew what she was going to do --- it would probably take Nate's help, and convincing him wouldn't be easy, but with four days, she thought she could do it. Knew she could.

Had to.

By the time she made it home that night, both of her brothers were already asleep. She ate some cold leftovers and flopped down on the couch, too tired to even take off any clothes. It had taken so much longer than she'd expected to get even half the information she needed, and watching the same building for hours had left her cramped and hungry.

She managed a few hours of sleep before a shrill alarm roused her bleary-eyed and grimacing. She knew herself well enough not to try picking up breakfast on the way, so she just grabbed what was left of the leftovers --- a half a loaf of stale bread and a stew that consisted of peas and not much else. She was up even before Lucas --- she'd left unfinished business the previous day.

The city was barely cold enough to be called brisk --- the last time Tabitha had allowed it to get outright cold was years ago, and the blowback was so intense that she'd walked the decision back within a week. Instead, she'd decided that the devices that created the clouds were to be shut off permanently, and so every day was exactly as warm and clear and beautiful as the next.

The horizon was glowing, and soon the stars would be out of sight, but next to none of the storefronts were illuminated yet. It had been a while since Amelia had been up this early, and she'd forgotten how peaceful it was to see the city before it switched on for the day. The only sound was the muffled plod of worn shoes on concrete and asphalt, and before she knew it, she'd reached the Silver Dollar.

Its windows were as dark as the hundreds of others nearby, but she proceeded with all the caution she could, ducking into an alley well before she got close. She emerged into an old parking lot that still had a few ruined tires in it, remnants of the very early days of the dome. Amelia's father had told her plenty of those first few months, when the citizens had picked every public place clean, either to hoard or to sell. The old world's government had apparently prepared for it, though, and between locks on every door and outdoor areas stripped half-barren already, the looting had died out within weeks, its energy deftly diverted to encourage the new occupation of scavenging.

The back of the Silver Dollar was nondescript, but Amelia had seen enough of those plain cement walls to recognize the motion detector, the mesh in the window, and when she squinted, the tiny cannon inside the building, hidden up in a corner and ready to incinerate her. Amelia set her jaw --- she didn't intend to go the same way as Tommy.

It was still a few hours until the place opened, and she couldn't risk looking in the window for fear of cameras, but Amelia had already seen everything she needed to. She picked up the food she'd brought, headed out through a different alley than she'd come in, and made her way to Charlie's courtyard.

The city was waking up, one store at a time. The few people who filled the streets were an indicator of the flash flood to come, but for now it still felt like she had the city to herself. By the time she reached the courtyard, that was barely the case, and she stepped in gratefully, ready to be away from the noise almost before it had started.

She was fifteen minutes early, but fifteen minutes later, Charlie hadn't shown. Amelia left her food on a bench and started to pace, the gravel crunching beneath her feet. The buildings leered down at her, their windows sparse and shuttered as always. Not for the first time, she wondered what exactly this place was.

Ten minutes past seven, she'd had enough of waiting --- the old cellar door was just too tempting. Amelia approached it slowly, nervous for reasons she couldn't quite pin down, and raised a hand to knock.

The door opened suddenly before she even got the chance, and she was greeted with the sight of a man she barely recognized and a powerful aroma of burnt sulfur. Part of Charlie's beard was singed black, and another was smeared a slaggy brown. The same hoodie and jeans were stained with a dull palette, and what skin was showing carried twice the burns it had before. He looked like he hadn't slept, and yet still he shaped his expression into a strained grin. "Man, I'm hungry."

It was a relief to get back into the rhythm, even if Charlie still insisted they weren't done with rolling. It took all of Amelia's willpower not to ask if they would ever do anything else.

Charlie held out his staff three feet above the ground, asking her to roll over it as if that weren't blatantly impossible. She landed on her back five times in a row, the wind knocked out of her, before Charlie gave her the staff in frustration and told her to hold it out like he had. He tucked into a tight roll, looking for a short moment as if he'd begun to orbit the staff, and landed on his side with a slap like thunder. Amelia didn't stare in wonder as she had a week ago --- she just furrowed her brow, trying to understand the movements behind the result. After a moment, she handed the staff back to him. "I got it this time."

She didn't have it that time, or the next, but after an hour, she was rolling well enough that Charlie stopped her. She was sweaty and bruised, but she didn't complain, and although the sun hadn't climbed over the tops of the surrounding buildings, they sat down for lunch.

"Where do you find this stuff, girl?" Charlie barely got his words out around a mouthful of bread, apparently not noticing that it was a few days old. "Either you're rich or invisible."

She barked a laugh. "Well, I'm not rich."

"And no one's invisible. You're going to get caught someday."

"That's where you come in." He just rolled his eyes, and Amelia furrowed her brow. "Are you alright?"

Charlie scratched his beard and winced at the lack of it. "I'm fine."

She'd have to tread carefully, but she did have to tread. "Something corrosive, huh?"

"Explosive, actually."

"Good at chemistry?"

Charlie shook his head and chuckled. "Your nose working alright? I smell like I've been burning rotten eggs. That was kinda the point, but..." He shook his head. "No, chemistry isn't my thing."

"Seems like you're getting by well enough, though."

"Didn't know you were such an optimist." He squinted at her. "You getting at something?"

Amelia swallowed. "Think you could mix something up for me?"

Charlie grunted. "What kind of something are we talking about?"

"I need something that can melt through tripwire glass." She fought not to wince.

The old man just raised his eyebrows and stared at her placidly. "Oh, so you've got a deathwish. That's cool."

"Can you do it?"

"Well, I'd kinda like to know what it's for. Y'know, the very least you could do?"

Amelia gritted her teeth. "I will if you tell me what you're doing in there."

"Uh huh. Girl, this is a bad idea. You don't have any business breaking into a place that wants to protect itself that bad. Stick to your day job. You've got a day job, right?"

"Yep," she replied stiffly, her mouth full. "The worst one there is. I'm the cashier at a pastry store."

"Full-time?"

"On the days I work."

Frustration flashed across Charlie's face, plain enough for her to read. "Well, what days *are* those, girl? You were here all the time last week!"

She grimaced. "It's not that important."

"Of *course* it's important! It's more important than this is, for sure!" Charlie gestured vaguely at the courtyard. "This? This doesn't get priority over your job, girl. I know you don't want to go, but if you won't do it for yourself, then do it for me, alright?"

Amelia sighed. "Alright."

"Good. Do you work tomorrow?"

She nodded, feeling terrible that she was still spinning the lie.

"Okay. Do your homework, and then we'll do this again on the weekend." He shook his head. "God, girl, half the time I don't know what your deal is."

Amelia nodded absently, looking at his singed beard and smudged clothes and thinking.

"I think we're done here." They had finished their food, and he was standing up, brushing crumbs off his hoodie. "Hello? I said---"

"You're working for the Resistance, aren't you?"

Charlie blinked. "Why---"

"You are." It fit too perfectly. "You're making a bomb for them."

He glared at her, but then shook his head and sighed. "Keep your voice down. No, I'm not working for them. I'm an... independent contractor, or something. And no, it's not a bomb, or at least not what you're probably thinking. They're not terrorists."

Amelia nodded slowly, unsure how to feel. "How did you get involved?"

"Oh, you couldn't pry that out of me with a crowbar." Charlie squinted at her for a long moment. "But I'll tell you what. If it strikes your fancy, there's an abandoned shoe store on fifty-third, halfway between Randall and Clementine. Trapdoor inside behind the register. Bring a flashlight, don't let anyone see you, and don't turn back when it gets rocky. Tell them you know me, tell them your name, and tell them the password is birdsong."

Amelia's eyes widened a little despite herself. "What, it's that easy? How do you know you can trust me?"

Charlie laughed. "Oh, girl, if you say the wrong password, you won't make it out of there alive. Besides, they change it every Sunday --- you're the one who has to trust me."

Amelia took a deep breath. She couldn't join the Resistance whether she trusted Charlie or not --- she didn't have the time, for one, and if Lucas ever found out, that would be the end of her.

But she knew where Charlie's sympathies lay, and that was more important.

"I need the acid to rob one of the worst loan sharks in the city." She swallowed and set her jaw. "I need it."

Charlie studied her for so long she had to struggle not to fidget. And then, after what felt like ten minutes, he gave the slightest of nods. "I'll need two days."
