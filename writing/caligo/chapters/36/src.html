# XXXVI: Coming up for Air

### nav-buttons



Ben pushed open the trapdoor and climbed out into the night, grimacing at the cold. It felt like it should have been a rush of blizzarding wind, but it was more like descending into an untouched vault, the air still and bitter. Even with all his clothes on, as massive as a stuffed turkey, the chill bit through to his skin. He didn't understand how the outliers did it. The little sympathy he had for them grew --- if only a little --- and he gave the idea of letting them into the city some thought for the first time. How much effect could ten thousand people have on an economy of millions, anyway?

He sat down a good way back from the edge --- he was terrified of the three-story drop --- and looked out at the dark city. It was nothing like night under the dome --- that seemed like nothing more than dusk in comparison. Here there were no lights, no dim ambient glow, and not even a moon, or at least not one he could see. It was something that the dome couldn't reproduce --- or didn't want to, maybe, and for good reason. It churned Ben's stomach in a primal kind of fear, and the thought that it wouldn't ever end with a sunrise was the worst part.

The silhouettes of buildings sprang up all around as far as he could see, and the dome itself blocked almost all of the stars to the east. A thousand feet tall, it looked barely a thousand feet away, so close he could jog over to it. He wished he could. Badly.

But that city was four miles away, and all that waited for him was enemies. How had he managed to anger so many people? All he'd wanted was a little independence.

He glanced down at the papers in his hands, reminiscent of the ones he'd stolen from Richard's office, and flicked on a tiny flashlight that Damien had given him. The batteries in his vault were how he kept the lights on, he told them, and that was a critical part of any patient's recovery. There was no morale in the dark.

Ben glanced back up at the inky black surrounding him and decided not to dwell on that.

He'd found the papers on the second and third floors on his way up. Those spaces weren't used for much anymore, the windows boarded up and the furniture a ransacked mess after being picked through many times over. Damien didn't bother trying to heat them.

There weren't any books in the building. The doctor lamented that, but no one else seemed to care other than Ben --- now that he finally had a chance to relax, they were all he could think about. The old accounting documents he had with him now were the closest thing he'd found. He skimmed through close to a hundred of them, looking for something interesting, or even just understandable, and found nothing. After ten minutes he slapped the sheaf of papers down next to the Cupid Bow in frustration.

His breath kept the tiny strip of exposed skin around his eyes from freezing, but the rest of him was slowly getting colder, and he'd have to return to the monotony before too long.

Ben stared at the dome, thoughts turning back to Amelia once again. After another eight hours, she was still "resting", or whatever her excuse was. No one needed to sleep for sixteen hours, and if she wasn't sleeping, she needed to talk. Charlie had told her they'd come up with plans, but the best they had was a half-formed idea to sneak into the Resistance and steal Vogel's gun, and that wouldn't even make a difference --- even without a ballistic, the plan between Vogel and Emerson would end up the same way. What they really needed was for every citizen to hear the facts and come to their own conclusions.

Ben rubbed his face, separated by several layers of fabric. He wished Amelia had asked him how he was doing or made any attempt to show she cared. Maybe he didn't deserve that anymore --- maybe he'd done enough that she didn't care how he felt. Maybe she was right.

But not an hour went by without him thinking of his father, probably tearing his hair out over a missing son --- a missing asset. Maybe he'd hear the news of the police officers knocked unconscious and conclude that Ben was still alive, and maybe that would only make him angrier.

The dome looked so small from where he sat, so lifeless. It was hard to believe one of the last bastions of civilization fit inside it, like the halo left around a missing sun --- the corona that had survived just a few seconds before vanishing too. Out here, it was easy to ignore that Tabitha was scheming, Vogel was manipulating, and Richard was... well, whatever he was doing. Wanting his son back, probably, just for reasons less clear.

Sure, it had been oppressive, and sure, he was freer now, but looking around at the cold, empty buildings, he couldn't help but wonder if this was really a better place to be.

And yet... and yet. If he hadn't taken this path, Vogel would have almost certainly overthrown Emerson without resistance, and Richard would have either had a higher place in government than before or be out on the streets, depending on how much of the upper class Vogel could afford to keep around while still saving face. Either way, Ben would still be under his father's hand, and he would probably want for nothing. Was that better than where he was now?

Of course not. All he'd wanted was adventure, and now that he had it, he was too afraid to take the responsibility. He gritted his teeth, and immediately the sniveling face of his argument instructor appeared before him, chiding him on the importance of always retaining calm, inside and out. He waved her away and grimaced, picking out one of the arrows from the quiver next to him. He shook it absently in the flashlight's beam, watching the powdered compound fling back and forth in the faintly yellow gas. Idly, as if he'd done it a hundred times before, he broke the shaft close to the arrowhead, then used what he'd snapped off to force the stump down inside the glass, breaking the rubber seal at the end of the shaft. He tossed the broken piece aside and held just the arrowhead upside-down, clicking off the flashlight. As he watched, a tiny spark blossomed into a little purple fire within as the argon slowly escaped and was replaced by air.

The flow of air was so slow that it took more than a minute before the rubidium burned out. When it did, the area around him was cast into shadow, and he hurled the spent capsule as hard as he could off the edge of the roof. For a moment, it made him feel a little better.

He heard footsteps behind him, then the creaking of wood, and when he turned to look, Nate was climbing out of the trapdoor. He stepped over and sat down next to Ben, but a little closer to the edge, his feet dangling over. Ben thought about telling him to be careful and decided there was no point.

They sat in silence for a while. The only way to tell time was going by at all was Ben's slow freezing. He was almost perfectly still, but Nate was restless, fidgeting with bits of gravel and his clothes and swinging his legs off the edge. Eventually, he turned to Ben. "You're still not gonna talk, huh?"

Ben sighed and shook his head. "I'm sorry. When Amelia's ready, she'll tell you."

"Why isn't she ready now?"

That was a harder question. "I don't know. I think it might... reflect poorly on her."

Nate looked back out without speaking. Ben could barely see his expression, but he knew the boy was close to tears, and it was only after a long time that Nate turned back and spoke carefully. "Would you keep this from me if you were her?"

Ben blinked, unsure how to answer or whether he should at all.

"I'm not going to tell her," Nate snapped. "I just want to know what you'd do. Can you at least tell me that?" He ran a hand over his hats and let out a pent-up breath. "Sorry. Just... would you?"

Ben sighed. "I would."

"She's in the Resistance, right?"

Ben gave him a glance. "That's right," he said slowly, nodding.

"And there's an anomaly with the structure of leadership?"

"Um."

"I've been talking to Heather."

"That's usually a bad idea."

"Yeah, she wasn't very helpful. But this anomaly is the problem?"

"That's right." Ben frowned. "But that's almost all of it. Everything that has to do with Amelia, at least. She knows you know all this?" Nate nodded. "And she still won't tell you the rest?" He shook his head, and Ben frowned. "I don't understand. Is there something I don't know here?"

For a moment, Ben thought he saw true fear in Nate's eyes, but it was impossible to tell in the darkness. "I don't think so," Nate said. "But you could tell me what you do know, and we could compare."

Ben looked sidelong at him. "Not a chance." The cold was seeping into his bones --- he needed to go back in.

Nate spoke up again after a moment, this time in a softer voice. "Do you think she's going to get better?"

Ben closed his eyes. It felt like he was talking to someone his own age, not a twelve-year-old. How had this kid grown up so fast? "I think her leg will heal nicely with Damien's help," he said, dodging the real question.

When Nate didn't answer, Ben sighed for what felt like the twentieth time and pointed out into the darkness. "Look that way."

"What's there?"

"An office building. Or, there used to be one, at least. Amelia and her Resistance party accidentally burned it down."

"What?"

"Margaret was telling me when we first got here. Apparently they were looking for batteries and ran into a bunch of feral dogs instead. They barely made it to the top floor, but that's where Margaret and her friends were hiding, and then they all had to run for it. Amelia showed them how to jump down to the next building over and roll."

"And did it work?" Here, at least, Nate was still very much twelve --- his face was starting to light up with excitement in the way only a child's could.

Ben shrugged. "Mostly. Some people sprained their ankles, and Margaret shattered her leg. The whole building went up in flames."

"Oh."

"Margaret still blames Amelia for it. She says if they hadn't shown up, a rescue party might have." He laughed dryly. "Even though they were eating dog and burning furniture."

"So she did the right thing," Nate said after a moment. "She saved them."

"Here's what I think." Ben took a long breath. "I think most of us are trying our best to be heroes. Sometimes we hurt other people by mistake, and sometimes we burn things we don't mean to, but we're just trying to be strong, or brave, or free." It didn't sound very profound to him, and he expected Nate to laugh.

He sniffed instead, almost too quietly to hear. "She hasn't been the same in months."

"But it's not to hurt you. She's just trying to be strong."

Nate nodded, his face turned away from Ben.

"It'll all work out," Ben told him, trying to believe it himself. "But right now, let's go back inside. I'm going to freeze."

Nate gestured at the papers as they got up. "What's with those?" he got out, looking for a different subject.

"Ersatz books. They're even more boring than they look."

"You like reading too?" Nate was starting to cheer up a little.

Ben grinned. "So it only took me sixteen years to find someone else who reads books. That's not too bad."

Nate proceeded to delve into everything he'd ever read as they made their way back inside, Ben clutching the papers and the bow. As he climbed down the ladder, Nate babbling a little too excitedly below him, Ben cast one more glance out across the roof. He'd meant what he said, but he hadn't answered Nate's question at all --- because the truth was that he didn't know if Amelia would get better, and he didn't know if he would, either.
