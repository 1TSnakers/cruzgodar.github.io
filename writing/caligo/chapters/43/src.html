# XXXXIII: Convergent Revolution

Charlie snorted himself awake, wishing immediately that he hadn't. The binds around his wrists and ankles cut deep, and he could have done without the feeling of being on a conveyor belt.

He shook himself out of his daze and looked at his captor. Her hood was thrown back, revealing short black hair and a face half-hidden in wrinkles. She was carrying him like a corpse to offer at an altar, and if that hadn't been terrifying, Charlie might have enjoyed the ride --- it was impossibly smooth.

He blinked and stared at her for a long moment before scowling. "You didn't need all that butter just to make robots, did you."

Heather didn't respond, just kept staring down the tunnel. She took an abrupt turn, and they began to descend down a staircase, Charlie feeling as if he were floating downward. The walls were stone, cut flat but unpolished, and the place was lit by a constant strip of fluorescent light on the ceiling. Charlie hadn't seen or heard a single other living thing.

"So, what now?" He felt at his restraints --- there was a bit of give in the rope binding his hands, but just a bit. Still, the rope was weak, and he wasn't. He hoped.

Heather didn't say a word, so he kept at it. "I don't know why I ever trusted you. Or Ben, for that matter. Should've left Amelia with Damien and gotten the hell out while I could."

"It is useless to consider scenarios that did not occur. It is worse still to consider those that never could have." Her voice was a little different, but the cadence was the same. Charlie kept his gaze off her face --- he wasn't about to see those eyes bleed again.

Heather turned another corner and headed down a different tunnel. They could have been going in circles, for all Charlie knew.

"So you were with the government this whole time?" He shook his head. "Why did you get us out of the prison?"

"I am not affiliated with any such organization."

This was ridiculous. "Then why?"

"I am interested in the wellbeing---"

"Yeah, I bet you are. You break us out of jail, help us get to a hospital, tell us we need to leave and go blow up the other side of the planet, and right after you help us get into the dome, you stab us in the back. Great way to care for the wellbeing of the city."

Heather was silent for a long while, and there was no sound at all --- even her footsteps were inaudible. When she finally did speak, it was in a tone even stranger than usual.

"Perhaps I am weak."

"You're something, alright."

"Or overly sentimental."

"Uh, *no*. Anything but." 

She grew quiet once more, and Charlie followed suit. It was barely a minute later that she drew to a stop in front of a simple cell with vertical metal bars, the first of many lining the sides of the hallway.

It was now or never. Charlie ripped his hands apart with all the force he could muster, and to his disbelief, the rope frayed and tore apart, leaving him free to shove himself out of Heather's grasp and onto the floor. He got to his feet, but his balance was unsteady with his feet tied together.

Heather was just staring at him, a neutral expression in human form. He raised his hands and tried to drop his stance as best he could. It ended up as a squat.

She approached him slowly. It was only a few steps, but it seemed to take minutes. Charlie was ready. 

And yet, when she took the final step, looking like she was about to lunge forward and strike, Heather was suddenly blurring out of view, and well before Charlie could process that, she had delivered a sharp blow to the back of his head. His ears rang and his vision spun, and he fell hard to his knees, then onto the ground.

He heard Heather opening the cell door, felt himself dragged inside, and saw the door close in front of him, but he was far away from it all. It was only when the key turned in the lock that Charlie squeezed his eyes shut, shook his head, and looked up at her blearily. "So," he slurred, "you gonna go do the same thing to Ben? Or was he in on this too?"

"His circumstances will end satisfactorily without intervention. Additionally, I do not possess the time."

"Busy woman, huh?" He laughed, feeling drunk.

Heather gave him one last look, and sure enough, her eyes had started to bleed. Charlie felt even sicker.

"We will meet again," she told him, walking away in her liquid gait. Charlie leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes, spent.

"Man, Amelia used to go on and on about what a great teacher you were. I'm not seeing much of that here."

He cracked an eye open and glanced over at the cell across from him.

"I could have done a lot better."

Charlie tried to laugh and groan at the same time and wound up with something that sounded like neither. "Oh, good, I can even see you this time."

Kate gave him a grimace that was almost a grin. "Lucky you."

The sheer emotion of stepping back inside the Golden Crown was nauseating. There was the usual fear and apprehension, but also, buried somewhere deep, a little ocean of nostalgia, cold and blue. That annoyed him, but there was nothing he could do to ignore it.

He had waited for a few hours in an adjacent alley before slipping in through the same back door he'd always used --- Ben didn't want to be inside the building a second longer than he had to. His card still worked, so apparently Richard hadn't had it deactivated. Maybe he'd hoped his son would come back scared and have to let himself in before begging at his father's feet for mercy.

The sheer cynicism of Ben's thoughts surprised him a little. Not for the first time, he started to think about the life he'd have when this was all over, but he snapped himself out of it quickly --- there was no room for error. He'd checked the security camera --- it didn't follow his movement, a sign of success --- then listened carefully at the door before entering. The interior of the building was as quiet as the world outside the dome, though, and it didn't look too different from that, either. No lights shone, no janitors cleaned sedately, no magnates gambled. Ben remembered suddenly that he had caused this, just a week ago. How easy it had been to forget that detail. He swallowed as he began to climb the stairs, flicking on the little penlight from Damien. The plan to undermine his father had been so much simpler when Heather was explaining it to him, when he hadn't had to see the impact first-hand.

Ben was panting after three floors and exhausted by the time he reached the top. There still wasn't a person to be seen. He passed dozens of security cameras, but all of them stared fixedly at the wall, not moving an inch to look at him, and he exhaled, relieved, after every one. All it would take was one camera tracking him, and he would be sure Richard knew, but he never saw one move the whole way there.

He couldn't stop himself from stepping into his room for just a moment. There was his bookshelf, lined with trinkets. Many of those had been brought by Mr. Lipcott. And there was his bed, his window, his wardrobe. So many familiar things turned foreign.

It was so strange, being back in that room. The nostalgia rose to high tide, and as he looked out over the lightening city, watching the citizens flow through the streets, he felt for just a moment as though he were back watching the drama in front of the Kepler building play out, back with classes to attend and a father to please.

He didn't miss it.

Ben turned his back on his room and made the short trip to the one filled with wires, cameras, and screens. And with a deep breath, he got to work.

Amelia emerged from the masses practically gasping for air. Every block from Charlie's courtyard had been a struggle, and when she reached the Watchtower and realized she wasn't too late, it came as a small surprise.

She couldn't take a deep breath, the bodies were crammed so tightly. She could only fight her way out from them, out and into the sudden void around the Watchtower. She flashed Lucas's ID at the ring of police as she passed, their sunglassed faces betraying not a hint of emotion. They didn't seem to care about her staff, nor did they bother to check the card --- the elevator would take care of that for them. Loitering near it or having an ID rejected were two easy ways to be taken into custody.

She walked into the shadow that was the first floor, ignoring frightened clerks and businesspeople alike and heading straight for the elevator. There were surely security cameras tracking her every move, and maybe even Tabitha herself was watching, but Amelia was past worrying about that. She strode to the elevator, swiped her card, heard the very loud *ding* that told everyone she was no interloper, and waited.

She made herself turn and look around in an effort to seem less suspicious. What caught her gaze immediately was the crowd, now seen from inside. The people were less frenzied and the guards less armed, but in every other regard, it was the gate all over again. She could spot the occasional outlier in the group, but by now the vast majority were citizens, springing from every background. They were held back by the invisible wall of fear, but that wasn't a wall that would hold forever, Amelia knew. This time, she wouldn't be the one to break it.

A second *ding* announced the elevator's arrival, and she backed in, her eyes still locked on the rippling mass. It was only when the doors closed that she shook her head and took a deep breath, trying to focus.

The elevator would only take her to the twenty-seventh floor --- Amelia remembered that much, at least. She was fairly sure there was another elevator that would take her up the final three, she just didn't know where to find it.

Past floor ten, then twenty. Not a single other person got on, a bit of luck she was grateful for, and she stepped out onto floor twenty-seven without complication.

Sure enough, another elevator, smaller, lingered on the edge of the room, flanked by guards. It seemed impossibly far away at first, until Amelia realized she was in the massive, UFO-shaped flare at the top of the Watchtower.

Lucas's ID wasn't going to get her anywhere near that elevator. A dozen ideas vied for space in her head --- she could pick the guards off from afar, one by one, with her rubigun. She could charge in and bludgeon them unconscious with Charlie's staff. She could distract them and make it in before they got back. Every one fell short in some way.

But then a businesswoman walked in front of her, self-important, and Amelia blinked. There was a better way.

The floor was set up in a labyrinthian fashion, walls turning away quickly and hiding passages. The farthest Amelia could see was to the other elevator, but she turned away from it and walked down one of the smaller, shorter corridors instead.

Amelia didn't go after the woman --- she couldn't afford to be seen. Instead, she moved through the halls under the cover of confidence, waiting for the smallest area, the most focused person, the easiest target.

It wasn't long before she found him, briefcase in one hand and legal pad in the other. He was hunched over, shuffling down a narrow walkway lined with cramped offices. It didn't matter where he was going, only where he was. Amelia shadowed him carefully, matching her footsteps to his, even if the floor was carpeted. When she was close enough to make out the stitches on his jacket, she reached delicately up to the pocket where she could see a wallet, and with a steady hand, pulled it out while he was walking. The man never noticed a thing.

She kept her pace matched to his, gradually slowing until she was far enough away to safely dart down a corridor. The wallet went in her pocket after she made sure there was an actual ID inside, and then she began walking as fast as she could without arousing too much suspicion.

A grunt and the bellow that followed it told Amelia that the man had found her out, but she was far enough away to have a little time.

She took turns almost at random, trying to catch another glimpse of the elevator that would take her where she needed to go, but all she saw were the terrified faces of employees and oligarchs. The anger of the man Amelia had stolen from seemed to have shattered the illusion of many that they would all be fine, and now they looked panicked, even if they didn't act it. A handful still wore masks of calm, though whether they had struck deals with Vogel or were really wearing masks, Amelia couldn't say.

Finally, the copper-tinted metal of the smaller elevator appeared around the corner of a bookcase, and Amelia forced her pace to slow, even as the shouting was growing louder and closer. She approached the guards, opened the wallet, handed one the ID, and watched in dread as he looked at the picture, then back at her, and frowned. "Not a chance."

He lunged forward and Amelia pivoted to the side, then immediately ducked to avoid a second. The first one rounded on her, and Amelia sidestepped to avoid them both, only to have her wrists grabbed and pinned by the third. The staff clattered to the floor, useless. It was clear within moments that it was pointless to struggle, but Amelia did it anyway, wrenching her wrists in vain attempts to pull them loose.

"Let's go," grunted the guard, pushing her forward, back toward the elevator that led down. "You've got some questions---" She cut off abruptly, then slowed to a stop. "What?" Another pause. "Are you --- yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am."

Amelia scowled. This was humiliating.

The guard hesitantly let her go, and she stormed back over to the smaller elevator, swiping her staff out of the hand of one of the remaining guards and waiting for the doors to open. All three guards looked skeptical about all of it, but they let her get inside and let the doors shut her in.

The ride was short. Amelia heard a familiar *ding*, quieter this time, and the elevator opened into a wide hallway paneled floor-to-ceiling in rich, fireproof wood. The handful of guards didn't so much as glance at her as she walked up to the small double doors and flung them wide open, revealing a modest chamber with a bookshelf, a desk, an abundance of meowing, and a tiny figure sitting at the far side, dwarfed by the wall-sized window that looked onto the city beyond. 

"Well don't just stand there gawking," Tabitha called, frowning at her. "Come give this poor old crone a hug."
