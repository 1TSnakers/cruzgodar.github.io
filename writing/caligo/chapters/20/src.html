# XX: Base Invaders

### nav-buttons



Ben felt like he was back on the high dive, taking small steps but looking straight down so he wouldn't see the edge. In that sense, leaving the Golden Crown was the climb up the ladder, the last chance he had to back out and be free of most of the shame.

He was sitting in the chair he'd pulled over to the window weeks ago. For a few days, the janitors had replaced it at his desk, but eventually they understood that he wanted to look out at the city more than his work. He barely remembered the last time he'd sat at that desk.

He turned the tiny drawstring pouch over in his hands, watching as the yellow fabric caught the light. It was smaller than a golf ball, though *much* heavier --- he'd almost dropped it when he tried to pick it up from Heather's seat the day before. Inside he could feel something like sand, gritty and loose.

He hadn't opened it, his usual curiosity muted and dulled. Maybe because opening it meant committing to actually doing this. Or maybe because he'd have to admit to himself that he'd committed long ago.

He still didn't know if he was really in control, or if Heather had orchestrated him from the beginning. The idea of being a pawn wasn't a particularly alarming one --- he'd grown up as pawn, waiting to cross the battlefield and become --- well, a king was more fitting than a queen, wasn't it? The only real advantage a king had over a pawn was moving backward.

Ben didn't know how long he stared out at the city, but when he finally looked at his watch and saw it was half an hour to noon, he couldn't put off admitting or committing any longer. He opened the pouch.

Inside was a small piece of paper. Ben pulled it out to reveal a silvery substance below that his eyes had no trouble focusing on. He frowned and set the pouch down on the windowsill --- gently --- before examining the card. It was typed, the ink feathering in a way that made Ben wonder if Heather had used an actual typewriter.

<span style="font-family: monospace">**Upend contents on head. Use at most two hours before effect is required. Use all of bag. Do not spill. Do not move or inhale while applying. Do not look at own body once applied. Do not move close to mirrors. Do not approach others.**</span>

Ben checked his watch once more. 11:35 --- that was at most two hours. He quailed a bit at the laundry list of warnings, but if it got him out of the Golden Crown and into the Watchtower, that was worth it, he told himself. Probably.

He ended up applying the dust while standing in the bathtub --- it made sense to do it somewhere he could clean later. If there was a patch of floor that couldn't be looked at, he would have a lot more questions than he could handle.

Ben closed his eyes, held his breath, gripped the pouch tightly above his head, and turned it sideways, shaking it a little to rain the dust down slow.

He felt it immediately, a tickling tingling sensation not unlike having an ant nest on his head. He barely fought off the urge to shake his head, run his hands through his hair, or scream. Instead he kept dusting himself, and as more silver poured onto him, Ben felt it trickling down onto his face, his neck, over his clothes.

It took thirty seconds before the pouch was empty, and another minute before the crawling sensation abated. When at last there was only a residual discomfort, Ben took a gasping breath and opened his eyes to see his bathroom, only... duskier. The room seemed gray, as if through a haze of smoke, or whatever it was. Ben hoped it hadn't gotten on his eyes. He took a step forward, out of the bathtub, and nearly threw up.

It took him a little while to understand why, and when he finally did, he took a shuddery breath at the thought of having this on for the next two hours. His vision was just *barely* lagging behind the world --- a tenth of a second, if that. But a tenth of a second delay was unimaginably disorienting. When he turned his head, the world hung a moment before turning too. When he walked, his surroundings stayed in place a moment too long and kept going after he had stopped. The lag wasn't present when he moved his eyes, but that almost made things worse. He took another deep breath, hopefully dust-free. It was going to be a challenge just to make it out of the building.

The nausea was debilitating. Ben felt sick with every step he took, and it was only with a focused effort that he made it to the door and listened carefully before pushing it open.

He hadn't heard wrong, thankfully, and the hallway was empty. He closed the door with some difficulty and began to walk down the hall, trying not to make a sound. It was Sunday, and so most of the staff was gone, but he still couldn't be too careful. The obvious downside was that Richard was home, but he hadn't come into Ben's room since the Kepler explosion. Besides, they weren't getting into his Watchtower office while he was there, whether they were invisible or not.

He moved out into the lobby-like area of the twenty-fourth floor and managed to get to the stairwell. The view downward was enough to make him consider taking the elevator, but the sound could attract staff, and if anyone saw the doors opening for no one, he'd be in trouble.

So instead he stared down at twenty-four flights of stairs, struggling to take the first step. When he did, it was a ginger, tentative thing, and he went more by the feel of his foot on the step than by sight. He tried another, and came very close to tripping, only a quarter of his foot on the stair. At this rate, the invisibility would wear off before he even left the building. Ben knew what he had to do, as terrifying as it was --- he held tightly to the railing, and closed his eyes.

It was immediately easier. He knew the number of steps by heart --- fourteen on the first half and ten on the second. Ben opened his eyes on the half-way landing, getting over to the other set of steps, and closed his eyes again. And he made it down twenty-four floors.

He passed someone else only once, on the ninth floor. On the landing, he pressed himself to the wall, waiting as a woman climbed and passed within a foot of him, completely unaware of the other presence. Ben let out a held breath when she was well past, more adrenaline rushing through him than he could deal with.

Then it was down another eight sets of stairs. He grew faster as he went, approaching a normal speed by the end. He opened his eyes to see two doors --- a small, nondescript one to the left, and a larger archway to the right. The back door and the lobby. He hated it, but the lobby was the safer bet. Richard would have posted guards outside after what had happened.

So instead he took step after slow step out into the lobby. There were two doormen by the entrance, something Ben had vaguely remembered but not planned for. The same logic applied here as at the other door --- he couldn't leave while they were watching. Ben stood still in the middle of the lobby, thinking. It was obvious what he had to do, but how to actually go about it was the question.

Finally, he looked over at an artisanal vase and sighed. Of course.

The doormen heard the rattling of china on wood and glanced over, bored. Then suddenly not at all bored, because a vase was teetering on its table, then falling, then spilling on the carpet. They ran over to it, confused but mostly panicked, mopping up the water stain and replacing the flowers and making sure none was damaged.

They never heard the pad of quickened footsteps to the door, or the tiny sound of the well-oiled hinge. But even if they had, they would have been unable to see the door open slightly, hold there, then push gently shut.

Ben found navigating the streets to be an exercise in patience. It was easy enough to walk the four blocks to the Watchtower, but only when he moved slowly and carefully next to the buildings, stepping out of everyone's way long before they were close to him.

He watched people's eyes. Not a single pair was looking at him, but no one seemed to mind. Maybe it was only because he'd known Heather was next to him that first time, and had tried to look at her, that he'd noticed he couldn't.

The Watchtower's plaza came into view at last, benches circling it outside its ring of shade. Ben chose one and sat down much harder than he intended. He breathed deep, trying to calm his racing heart, and checked his watch --- 12:05.

"You are late." He expected it this time, and even spoken into his ear, Ben smiled dryly. They were really doing this.

God, they were really doing this.

"I am," he murmured back. Then, his expression curdling a bit, he added, "You didn't tell me this would mess with my vision."

"Such are the limits of technology."

"And what kind of technology are we talking about?"

"A fleet of continuous-optic-relaying, retinal-irritant-producing, self-propelled automatons."

"You gave me a bag of drones? I'm covered in *drones*?"

"Your volume is unsuitable for our purposes."

"I can't believe you," Ben muttered. "Where did you find a typewriter, by the way?"

"I am unaware of a suchly named object."

He groaned inwardly. "The thing you typed the warning card on?"

"That item was handwritten."

Someday, he was going to see what this person actually looked like. At this point, if she had eight eyes and was covered in tentacles, he wouldn't have been surprised. "Alright," he muttered, trying to focus on what mattered. "What's our plan?"

"We must first enter the elevator. We will wait outside until someone exits, then enter and travel to the twenty-seventh floor. I will unlock Parkington's office and we will search it. There will be camera coverage in the elevator and all offices. Do not speak before we are out of this coverage."

"Can the cameras see us?" He wasn't taking another step if they could.

"We are enveloped in meshes of outwardly reflective nodes. Cameras will interpret this as mirror-like."

"Alright," Ben said slowly. "Is that it?"

"Yes. I will follow you."

"How will you know where I am?"

"You are perceptible under my vision."

"And you're about to tell me you don't have any retinas?"

Heather didn't answer, and Ben grunted in frustration despite himself. He wished he were doing this with Amelia. Then he remembered that no, he didn't, and then that maybe he did.

"Move," said Heather, and he stood up almost gladly, leaving the complicated thoughts on the bench and walking slowly toward the Watchtower. He moved calmly through the crowd, all his attention focused on coordinating his motion and vision, until a shadow passed over him, the Watchtower's flare hundreds of feet above casting a near-circular shadow at noon. And then he was under the awning, in the atrium, near the elevator shaft in the center. Ben walked up to one side of it and pressed himself against the wall, hoping Heather would do the same on the other side. He stayed there, unnoticed, and waited.

And waited. His heart beat a little faster, pounded a little louder in his head. He could hardly hear himself think, but he wasn't trying to think anyway.

Finally, delivering such a shock he almost screamed, came the *ding* that heralded their transportation.

Ben waited while two women walked out and over to a desk before moving around and into the elevator. He hoped Heather was following him. Reaching out, he pressed the button labeled 27 --- the highest this elevator went --- and hoped for the best.

It took an agonizingly long time for the doors to close, and then they were lifting up, skyward.

Ben swallowed many times on the way up, trying to remain as silent as possible. The cameras would pick up two body-shaped mirrors, but as long as they didn't have his voice, he was fine.

Relatively speaking.

The doors opened to two guards halfway down the hall who glanced at the empty lift in confusion. Ben was out and past them before they could step into the elevator and look around. When there was no shout of alarm, he knew Heather had made it too.

He'd never been up here, but one glance around made him wish Richard had brought him to work, even once --- this place was *stunning*, all clean lines and smooth walls. The twenty-eighth floor was the largest, but this was very close, hallways stretching a hundred feet before they ended in massive glass windows. Ben had no idea where Richard's office was, so he just started walking.

By now, he'd almost gotten used to the altered vision that came with the invisibility, as if his mind had somehow corrected. He padded down the hall, passing office after office, large and small. Most had their blinds drawn and their doors locked, and Ben said another silent thanks to Heather for picking a Sunday.

They had almost reached the end when Ben heard a whisper behind him. "What is your intention?"

"I don't know. I've never been here before."

There was a beat, and then she said, "I question why I allowed you to join me."

Ben raised his eyebrows. "Was that a joke?"

"No."

It made him want to laugh, an absurd but welcome feeling in the midst of all the panic. He smiled and turned the corner and came within a foot of hitting someone.

The woman stopped a few feet away, then turned and looked back, squinting. Ben watched her gaze drift away from him, his heart racing, and saw as her eyes narrowed. He moved away as fast as he could without making too much noise.

"Make haste," Heather breathed behind him. Ben didn't bother to reply, walking quickly down the aisle. It ringed the entire floor like the farmland ringed the city, floor-to-ceiling glass windows casting beams of light on the dozens of desks. Every one was pushed up against the glass so that those working could see the yawning city below. Ben wasn't sure why they were there when the only people on the floors had their own offices, but he liked them nonetheless. They reminded him of what he thought a library should look like.

They kept up their pace, darting down another hallway. The sheer number of titles amazed him --- Assistant Director of Agriculture, Chair of Thermal Studies, Senior Structural Engineer, Director of Construction Management.

Ben glanced up above that last title, and sure enough, his father's name was printed in block letters on the door itself. Ben could hardly believe they meant to do this.

He took a step back, letting Heather come closer to the door. His eyes drifted away involuntarily, but that was just as well --- he could keep watch.

But apparently that wouldn't be necessary. Almost immediately, Heather whispered, "It is open."

Ben turned to see the door ajar, the deadbolt sheered neatly off --- half still attached to the handle, half left flush in the door.

Heather stepped in quickly and closed the door in Ben's face. There were a handful of small crunching sounds, and then the door was open again, all before he even had time to be offended.

Ben stepped inside, looked at the table, lamp, wall of file cabinets, and broken security cameras, and was... unsurprised. This was what he'd imagined, give or take a few pieces of furniture.

He was still staring when Heather hissed, "The seeking will have already begun. Begin."

That made just enough sense to galvanize him. Ben pulled one of the cabinets open, removing the papers inside and rifling through them. Storing records on paper was a luxury, but then again, so was storing them digitally. He wasn't sure which was more expensive, but if Richard had paper, his money was on that.

But these held nothing but reports of other people's buildings, most of which he'd never even heard of. Definitely not sensitive material. He flipped through them within half a minute and then checked all the desk drawers, finding nothing there either, and he turned around, pacing with worry. They couldn't have come all this way for nothing. He knew there was something hidden here, but *where?* He gave the room another glance and settled on the desk again. Maybe there was something he hadn't noticed? He walked back over to examine it, and saw it almost immediately. It was textbook --- one of the drawers was taller outside than it was inside by a few inches.

Ben took the papers out and spent a stressfully long time trying to open the false bottom. Eventually, he found the release --- a small lever, almost flush, that had to be lifted up and pushed back. The bottom lifted up, and sure enough, there was another stack of papers below. Ben picked them up and glanced over the top page. Then he blinked, and looked again. "Heather," he called softly, and he knew she was nearby by the small perturbations in the air. Neither of them spoke --- just the top sheet left even Heather quiet for once.

They'd struck gold.
