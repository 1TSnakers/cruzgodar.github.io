They were the highlights of his weeks, but Ben&#x2019;s journeys out were the exception to the mind-numbing rule. The rest of his time was still spent indoors, juggling classes and... not much else. It was easy, juggling one thing, but never fun.

He started to comb his hair every morning, with little effect. His curls stayed nearly as curly, and mostly it just hurt. At one point, he found an electric razor among the massive selection of tools in his bathroom and removed the ghost of a beard he&#x2019;d been growing for the past year. He squinted at himself when it was gone, wondering for a moment if he&#x2019;d made a mistake and for a shorter one if he should just shave his head altogether.

He had better things to do than stare at himself in the mirror. Didn&#x2019;t he? Apparently not &mdash; he would stay there for ten minutes at a time, examining himself in morbid fascination. The more he looked, the more problems he found &mdash; greasy skin, a lumpy nose, a head that barely reached five foot seven. The first time that last thought surfaced, it was surprising enough to make him storm out of the room &mdash; annoyed with himself, but mostly just disappointed.

He still collected the newspapers, making a stack in an empty wardrobe cabinet, even though they had next to nothing about Kepler these days. Work was finishing up across the street, and the smell had begun to wane. Then again, he couldn&#x2019;t smell much of anything anymore, so maybe not. Still, he expected the employees would be able to return soon &mdash; all of them. They were lucky Richard had been looking out for them. If they hadn&#x2019;t evacuated &mdash; well, the blast itself would have been dangerous, even if small, and Ben shuddered to think what effect the substance would have had so close up.

Ben began scanning the papers for descriptions of the attackers &mdash; for a description of Kate. For all Amelia had confirmed his suspicions, he still couldn&#x2019;t believe it was true. Surely there was more than one Kate in the city who matched the bill. Surely.

These handful of newspaper reports were all the publicity the Resistance got &mdash; for the most part, if they didn&#x2019;t do anything, no one talked about them. Ben had long found issue with that, but he understood why well enough &mdash; every publisher was playing a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma, only willing to talk about dangerous people if others were too &mdash; when they could guarantee they wouldn&#x2019;t be the sole targets.

There wasn&#x2019;t much on Kate specifically, but Ben did find four mentions of Charlie. One was two-line nonsense, describing him as in his mid-thirties. Another, reading like a conspiracy theory, claimed he was actually someone named Damien.

The other two descriptions had substance, though. Ben had skimmed them before, but now that he was going through carefully, he picked up on a few details he had missed. The man was apparently some kind of scientist, both papers agreed, and he had been the one to make the bomb. One source said he&#x2019;d been holding it when the rebels entered the building, and the other that he&#x2019;d planted it there beforehand. It wasn&#x2019;t clear how he&#x2019;d gotten the cesium he apparently used, other than the general term of *black market.* Cesium was technically legal in the city, but the wildly expensive permit needed to sell it meant most transactions went unlogged.

There was no mention of martial arts &mdash; Ben figured he wasn&#x2019;t skilled or famous enough before Umbra to get his name anywhere. He wondered if Amelia had really gotten the best instruction before asking himself why he cared.

The papers had plenty he didn&#x2019;t know, but all the big questions Ben had went unanswered. Why Kepler? Why now? Why weren&#x2019;t there any casualties, and most importantly, who was Richard&#x2019;s contact? He&#x2019;d ask Heather about it on Saturday, but even that made him nervous &mdash; he&#x2019;d met with little success learning a thing about Richard and the temperature. His father was gone more and more, spending inordinate hours at the Watchtower and locking himself immediately in his office when he came home.

But on Friday, when he&#x2019;d resigned himself to having nothing to report, the wall spoke for the first time in weeks.

&#x201C;The construction is going well.&#x201D; That was Richard, but he sounded different from the other phone calls. His voice was stronger, more confident. And when the other person responded, Ben understood why &mdash; it wasn&#x2019;t the scratchy-voiced man.

This voice was thinner, higher-pitched, and creaked rather than rasped. It was obfuscated through the static, but Ben would have known it anywhere &mdash; it was the mayor.

&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;it is. Now if only you could be that fast on your taxes.&#x201D; Ben blinked &mdash; he&#x2019;d only ever heard her voice on the broadcasting screens, and there was never a trace of humor there.

&#x201C;Some things can&#x2019;t be rushed.&#x201D; Richard made a foreign noise that could have been a laugh. &#x201C;And the restructure?&#x201D;

&#x201C;Still going. The Benedict district is underway right now, but it could be a couple weeks before the Resistance loses power.&#x201D; Emerson paused. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t actually want another geothermal plant, do you.&#x201D;

&#x201C;No, of course not. That would cost millions.&#x201D;

&#x201C;And give us some heat.&#x201D; She sighed. &#x201C;Fine. Make the proposal and I&#x2019;ll find an excuse to veto it.&#x201D; After a moment, she went on. &#x201C;Have you begun construction on the new police headquarters?&#x201D;

&#x201C;I received the finished plans yesterday. We should be able to start on Monday.&#x201D;

&#x201C;There&#x2019;s been a slight change of plans &mdash; we&#x2019;ll be hiring five hundred instead of three.&#x201D;

Richard cleared his throat, and Ben thought he could hear the annoyance in his voice if he really tried. &#x201C;There won&#x2019;t be room for another two hundred.&#x201D;

&#x201C;Make room. We&#x2019;re losing more than we&#x2019;re bringing in, and it&#x2019;s embarrassing. At the bare minimum, we need to at least *look* like we&#x2019;re fighting the Resistance.&#x201D;

Richard was quiet for a long moment. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll find a way,&#x201D; he said eventually. &#x201C;And &mdash; one thing.&#x201D;

The mayor didn&#x2019;t respond, and eventually Richard continued. &#x201C;Be careful with her. She&#x2019;s unpredictable.&#x201D; He said it roughly, and hung up.

It all rattled around Ben&#x2019;s head. It was finally making sense why Kate was so terrified of the restructure. Between Richard, Emerson, and the other man Richard talked to, the Resistance was facing a serious opponent. Ben knew he should be proud of his father.

But doubts still ate at him. Why didn&#x2019;t Richard want the geothermal plant built when the city seemed to need it? He couldn&#x2019;t tell if his worries were founded or if he just resented his father for his own reasons.

At least he&#x2019;d have plenty to tell Heather. Knowing that he had someone to talk to eased his mind a little.

But something *still* didn&#x2019;t feel right. He was going to talk to Heather, and...

And *be careful with her. She&#x2019;s dangerous.*

Of course &mdash; who else could they be talking about? She&#x2019;d already presented herself as a threat when she tried to talk to the mayor directly.

He had to warn her.
