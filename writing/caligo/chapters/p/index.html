The light of a sun shone over it all, but most streets were too engulfed by buildings to glimpse it for more than a few hours each day.</p><p class="body-text">They had come from everywhere, showed up two years before or two weeks after. The largest group was of course the natives, the Los Angeles wealthy who hadn&#x2019;t truly been made to sacrifice a thing, but there were little diasporas from every rich corner of an old world gone dark. And in this little pocket of civilization that had been built for them, that they had spent most or all of their fortunes on, they had constructed buildings of all kinds &mdash; a challenge to all the culture lost. A declaration that life could carry on just as richly as it had.</p><p class="body-text">So they said. For most, it was little more than a means to an end, a slippery grasp at the lifestyle they&#x2019;d once had. Still, the result was a cornucopia of services and stores. Libraries, brothels, pastry shops, opium dens. Cocaine, corpses, cesium, even coffee &mdash; it was all readily available in the right places, with the right friends, maybe even the right knock.</p><p class="body-text">And the citizens led lives more varied than the buildings they led them in. Tailors and courtesans, government officials and mercenaries, and most of all, police. Everywhere, the police. Black-suited and tight-lipped, they patrolled the streets with feline detachment and canine ferocity, always with one hand near a rubigun. Many were unafraid to speak out against them. More were not.</p><p class="body-text">Tommy was wandering the alleys, picking fervently at the piles of trash against the walls &mdash; there was no garbage collection this far toward the edge &mdash; and he&#x2019;d managed to find a few bags of expired snacks. No fresh fruit, not yet, but he was hopeful.</p><p class="body-text">He had a sister to get back to. She wasn&#x2019;t meant to be a caretaker, always snapping at him and making a point to be gone when he was home, but Tommy didn&#x2019;t have the presence of mind to grasp that. He was only ten, after all, though his stick-thin figure made him look younger and his rough manner of speech made him sound older. He had been born in the city, had never seen what was outside and never thought to care. His days were simple &mdash; gather enough food to keep two people alive. His sister had a job, but it didn&#x2019;t pay much and that money went up in smoke more often than not, so it usually fell to him to get the food.</p><p class="body-text">He was almost to the end of the alley when he saw it &mdash; a guarded cart was passing by in the street the alley bordered, piled high with fresh green apples. They&#x2019;d been grown in the dense jungle that ringed the city &mdash; called farmland, though it used no soil. These apples were the size of Tommy&#x2019;s head, each weighing ten pounds easily, and one had fallen off. It bounced and rolled on the open street, in the middle of the gap the cart had left in the crowd.</p><p class="body-text">Tommy didn&#x2019;t have time to think &mdash; he took off running as fast as his bony legs would carry him to the middle of the street. There were others moving toward the apple, but wild desperation got him there first. He hefted the fruit up, and with the thought of running suddenly far from his mind, took a massive bite.</p><p class="body-text">It was the best thing he&#x2019;d ever eaten, and it would be the last.</p><p class="body-text">Tommy and his sister couldn&#x2019;t afford new clothes &mdash; or used ones. The best they could do was stitched-together scraps of cloth, and one downside of that was that the rags weren&#x2019;t flame resistant, as had become standard practice decades ago around the world. So when Tommy heard the <em>click</em> of a rubigun being trained on him and a policewoman&#x2019;s voice asking him what the hell he thought he was doing, when she fired and a ball of powdered rubidium flew out of its argon-filled chamber and into Tommy&#x2019;s back, reacting instantly with the air and igniting in purple flame, those scraps lit quickly. They scorched his back and quickly his front as well, and although he dropped the apple and tried to put them out, it was useless. They were too many, and too hot, and he didn&#x2019;t think to roll and smother them until it was too late. He collapsed as the cart rolled on, and the dozens who tried to help the boy and eventually got the fire out were much too late.</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p><p class="body-text">The city churned on, smog rising more now that morning had passed. Barely a mile away and around the same time, an old man entered a shady establishment and returned with several chunks of lumpy gray rock, stowing them in a ratty backpack and taking his leave. The city didn&#x2019;t notice. It rarely noticed anything, and when it did, it was little beyond distracted acknowledgment swallowed quickly by apathy.</p><p class="body-text">By midday, nearly every street was crammed full of people &mdash; even all the way out to the glass-covered, hydroponic, jealously guarded farmland whose every cubic foot was bickered over. The crowding stretched inward, too, traffic without a single car to be seen. The five million people crammed into less than eighty square miles made for a population density greater than any the world had known before. They packed like anchovies onto the asphalt, sometimes waiting hours to move half a mile to their destinations. For a select few, that was the Watchtower, the towering thirty-story behemoth that stood in the center of the city. Its first twenty-six floors were impossibly thin, while the final four flared wide in a jab at physics.</p><p class="body-text">And at the top, her office occupying the entire floor, sat the mayor. She gazed through her massive windows to the sky that was unnaturally bright to her and the older residents but business as usual to the youngsters. The sky that looked far away but was really no more than a few short miles until an impressively large LED array on top of glass on top of a vast steel structure, a dome so massive it housed not a city but a world &mdash; one last smoking, shaking, stationary ark after the flood of darkness, the great human extinction, the beginning of the end, fourteen years ago.</p><p class="body-text">Umbra.</p><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main><script src="/scripts/init.min.js"></script></body></html>
