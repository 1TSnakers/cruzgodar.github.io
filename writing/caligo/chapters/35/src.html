She had to save someone.

She had to save someone, and she couldn't remember who.

The world was spiraling around her in browns and purples as if she were oxygen-deprived, and she wasn't even sure she was standing on solid ground.

But she had to save someone. Garbled names and bits of faces flashed into focus and were gone just as fast, and none of them was who she wanted. All she could do was drift, tumbling and turning through the void and hoping she remembered.

There was a gun in her hand. How long had that been there? She recalled with a dim lurch that she stole it. A ballistic gun, all hers. What use could she possibly have for a gun? Or --- but, no, it wasn't hers. She was just the courier, just the go-between. That was good. She didn't want the stomach-clenching fear that came with holding it, not if she didn't have a good reason.

She turned around in the ether to head back home, but she wasn't quite sure where that was. Before she could think, though, the wisps of her attention were snagged by the soldiers in front of her, and the massive machine guns they held like staves, every one as tall as her. She couldn't even find it in her to hold the pistol up at them --- it was hopeless. They lifted their guns as one, a firing squad that stretched to infinity in both directions, and she closed her eyes.

And felt the bullets ripping through her, tearing her limb from limb until long after she was sure it could go on no longer.

*Click.*

Amelia opened her eyes hesitantly, nearly blinded by the light. She was firmly on two feet and warmer than she thought possible. In her hands was a timecard, freshly punched, and she stared at it with the same confusion she'd given the gun.

Slowly, she turned around to stare through a doorway and beyond a counter into a tiny dining area, speckled with empty chairs and wrapped in aging walls with windows too bright to see out of. She stepped through and rested her hands on the counter, watching the door. It was perfectly serene.

And silent. No one else was in the building, and though the drop of loneliness that fell dissolved quickly into the ambient, she could still feel it, and it would only grow if she waited.

But the peace of the place held her. She closed her eyes again and smiled, breathing in the warmth.

But her smile twitched, shook, and faltered. Something nagged at her mind, and as she focused closer on it, she felt the horrifying dread of opening a basement door in the dark of night. She became aware of the buzzing of flies, then the shouting of coworkers, then the demands of customers. She squeezed her eyes tighter, trying not to hear it, and for a while that worked, but what was left was even worse. The silence, the emptiness, the lonely uniformity stretching ahead for miles, it *ate* at her.

Until at last, her eyes opened practically on their own.

Someone was staring at her from across the counter, examining her, much too close for comfort. Amelia's eyes widened immediately, and she tried to step backward, but her back was pressed up against something soft. She thrashed and tried to push the man away, and he moved back, out of her reach and not so threatening.

"Amelia. Amelia, can you hear me?"

She stopped the violent motions, slowly, and squinted at the man. His face was a little familiar, silhouetted against the glowing windows, but it was blurry and dim in her memory. She thought about saying something and decided against it, just nodding.

"Good. You stay right there. I'll bring some friends." He disappeared, walking up the stairs in the corner. Had there always been stairs over there? She couldn't quite remember.

"You really can't take a hint."

Amelia leaned back against the soft wall behind the counter and glanced over at the hospital bed next to her. A woman was propped up in it, flipping through a newspaper. Amelia couldn't see her face clearly.

"Why are you here?" she asked. "Shouldn't you be in a hospital?" Her words came out jumbled and slurred.

"Don't let him catch you saying that." She chuckled darkly. "God, you're *really* out of it, aren't you? Must be a hell of a story if you're on that many meds." She turned toward Amelia. "So? What happened?"

And Amelia recognized her, and the warm interior of the pastry shop dissolved around Margaret's face. When she looked back toward the stairs, it was gone completely, replaced by concrete walls racked with medical tools.

Footsteps sounded, and Damien reentered the room, followed by Charlie, Ben, Heather, and Nate, the last one looking meek and thoroughly out of place.

For a long moment, no one spoke. Then Charlie gave Nate a gentle push, and he approached the bed cautiously. Amelia hugged him tight as best she was able, and for a long while they stayed that way, neither of them making a sound. Nate didn't even cry. When he finally let go and stepped back to the others, she finally felt completely awake.

"How long?" she asked Damien. Her voice was still a croak.

"About eight hours. That's not bad for what happened to you."

"And what was that?"

He took a breath. "You were lucky. Luckier than you had any right to be. You were shot in your left calf, but the bullet didn't hit bone."

Damien trailed off at the end, and it was clear he was leaving something out. "But?"

"But it nicked an artery. You were bleeding like crazy, and if it wasn't for this one" --- he gestured at Heather --- "you would have died. She tied the tightest bandage on you that I've ever seen, and she knew exactly who I was. Got here in half an hour."

Amelia shook her head slowly. "No way she did. It's a lot longer than that."

Charlie cleared his throat. "She gave us directions and ran ahead. Could win the Olympics with that speed."

"If that bullet had been a millimeter to the left," Damien went on, "you'd have had a hole in your artery, and I don't have anything here to patch something like that up. I'd have had to amputate half your leg. You probably still would have died."

Amelia nodded absently, a little more aware of the dull pain in her calf. "Is it good now?"

"Very good. But you won't be walking for quite a while." He glanced at her hands. "You had some serious burns, too --- you know those can get infected if you're not careful, right?" He shook his head again. "You should never have gotten involved in whatever this is. You're lucky to be alive."

She mouthed the words after him. They didn't make her afraid --- didn't make her much of anything.

"Amelia. Do you understand what happened?"

"Yeah." She snapped her gaze back. "Yeah, I understand." She looked past him at the other four. Heather was a statue and Nate had interested himself in the swaths of tools on the walls, but Ben and Charlie were shifting nervously, unable to stand still. She caught their attention. "Got something to say?"

Charlie cleared his throat. "Yeah, I guess we do. Uh, doc, you think you could take the kid upstairs? We need to talk alone."

Nate rounded on them. "This is *ridiculous*. I deserve to know what the big secret is."

Amelia furrowed her brow and glanced between the two of them. "Uh, okay. Nate, go with Damien for now, and we'll catch up later. I just need to hear what these guys have to say first."

"*So do I.* Ugh, *fine*." He stepped away from the bed. "Just tell me what they tell you, okay?"

Amelia nodded hesitantly. Damien gave a few instructions to her --- don't turn over, don't mess with the IV, absolutely don't try to walk --- before leading Nate over to the stairs.

"Hey doc," Charlie murmured, catching Damien's attention. He nodded slightly at Margaret, who raised her hands in disbelief.

"I can *see* you." She crossed her arms and glowered at him.

Damien frowned. "Look. I can respect that you want privacy, but neither one of these two is moving for a *long* time. Either Margaret hears what you have to say or you don't say it."

Ben looked sick, and Charlie grunted. "Fine. If she's bedridden anyway, it shouldn't matter."

"Excuse you. I'm getting damn close to walking again."

Heather spoke up before anyone else could. "Do you receive visitors?"

"More than the little arsonist over there has." That earned Amelia some weird glances, but no one paused to ask.

"Very well," Heather said. "If you communicate the information we will discuss to a person not currently in this room, I will neutralize them before they are able to leave."

"Whoa no no no!" Damien rushed back down the stairs and stood in front of Heather. "Don't threaten my patients! Who do you think you are?"

"No threats were made against patients in this establishment."

Charlie gave a nervous laugh. "I think what she means is that we'd just like our conversation to be private. No violence necessary." He grinned nervously at Damien and Margaret. "Think we can roll with that?"

It took a little more convincing, but in the end, Damien took Nate back upstairs and Margaret lay back with her eyes closed and her arms crossed, a begrudged courtesy. By now Amelia was sitting up straight. She had no idea what to expect.

But nobody said a thing. Even Heather looked unsure of how to begin.

Amelia asked the question on the top of her mind. "Do you know if Kate and Travis made it back safely?"

Charlie barked a laugh, but stifled it with a cough. "Yeah. Uh, that's kinda where we need to begin anyway. So..." He looked at Ben and Heather, clearly willing one of them to talk, and when neither one did, he sighed and kept going. "So. Did you know the doc here is really interested in the Resistance?" Amelia shook her head, and he went on. "He's like a news source for the people out here. Spends his spare time collecting rumors from his patients that *they* got from citizens they met on the street. Sometimes he gets lucky and meets those citizens firsthand. Sometimes he's *really* lucky and they're Resistance."

"Okay. So?"

"So he knows that Kate and her... very supportive friend made it back in one piece with the gun."

Amelia nodded. "Great."

"Right, well, maybe not so great. You got something to hold onto?" She glared at him, and he just gestured at Ben. "This one here's got some crazy theories about what's really happening."

Amelia frowned at Ben. "Is this what you were trying to tell Kate?"

He swallowed and fiddled with some kind of device in his hand. "Yes. It's --- well, it's..." Ben looked at Charlie, who jutted his head back at him in defiance.

"The Resistance and government are in cooperation," Heather said simply, not so much as looking at the others.

Margaret's eyes shot open and she sat up to look at all of them, but Amelia barely noticed. "Like, what, a peace deal or something?"

"Uh, no, not really," Charlie said hesitantly. Ben wouldn't meet her eyes. "More like they were corrupt from the get-go."

Ben pressed a button on whatever it was that he held, and Vogel's voice crackled out from it, unmistakable.

*The restructure is reaching the Resistance as we speak. The mayor's set to make her speech tomorrow morning.*

*Yes. I'll be there. I'll propose a plant and she'll veto it and take the fall.*

*She told me. Look, you don't need to keep me informed --- I'm closer to Emerson than you'll ever be. You're the one who needs information, not me.*

*Very well.*

*You're *sure* your prison guards have what we need?*

*I'm certain of it.*

*You better be. If you mess this up, I will make sure you lose *everything*. Do you understand?*

Amelia glanced between the three of them, Ben looking like he was at a funeral, Charlie as if he were on hot coals, and Heather as though she had fallen asleep standing up with her eyes open. And Amelia laughed, really laughed, for the first time in days, because it was just such a *hilarious* idea. The Resistance, the secret underground organization plotting to take over the government for years, secretly in league with the very thing they were trying to overthrow. It was ridiculous. She laughed for what felt like minutes --- every time the humor began to dwindle, she'd remember why she was laughing again and fall back into it.

She laughed so hard all the pain and heartbreak and stress of the weeks before melted away. So hard that her lungs began to hurt, and something else near them too.

And so hard she began to cry.

When the tears had dried and she'd wiped her face enough to have something like composure, she stared all of them down. "Why?"

For once, Ben answered. "That's what I couldn't figure out at first. I'm pretty sure Vogel's so well-liked by the outliers because she's promising them entry into LA."

"Yeah," said Margaret, looking at them with narrowed eyes. "That's what most people out here think."

"Right, so if she's working with Mayor Emerson, who absolutely doesn't want the outliers inside, then there would have to be a reason for it."

"You don't think she actually wants all of them to come in?"

"No, I don't. We talked to Damien, and in the six years the Resistance has been around, they've made two trips out here to help the outliers. *Two*. Don't you think they would be doing something more if Vogel wanted them to?"

Amelia chewed her bottom lip. "Maybe she's under the mayor's control. Maybe she just can't do what she wants to."

Ben nodded. "Okay, but then why wait so long? The mayor hasn't lifted a finger against the Resistance. The biggest thing she's done is this power outage, and I don't even know what that's accomplished."

"Could've been trying to incite some panic," Charlie murmured. "Give some urgency."

"Maybe. The point is that she could have arrested or jailed or killed the Resistance members at any time and gotten rid of a major threat. And she didn't."

"So..." Amelia rubbed her head. "So Vogel is the one controlling Emerson."

"I don't think so. Otherwise Vogel could have just forced her to step down or rig an election or something. And it doesn't explain the gun."

"Okay?" Amelia was out of options. "So what do you think is actually going on?"

"I think Vogel wants support. I think she wants to make it seem like she's taking over when she's actually just taking Emerson's place. If she's backed by everyone who hated the old mayor, then she can keep power without seeming like a monarch. A revolution where the leader is chosen by the agency being overthrown isn't that uncommon in history."

Amelia felt empty. Everything she'd worked at for months was decaying around her.

"But!" Ben was getting excited now. "That *still* doesn't explain why Emerson's going along. No counterstrikes, no complaints. Nothing. That's what I couldn't understand, until I talked it through with Charlie." He looked up at the old man expectantly.

"The strike's in a week," Charlie told Amelia slowly. "It used to be in six months, and now it's in a week. What major event happens a week from now?"

Amelia blinked, thinking, and eventually shook her head tiredly. "The train," she murmured. "The train departs in a week."

"Emerson *wants* this," Ben said. "She's old and tired. She plans to take the train to York and leave Vogel as her unofficial successor. It's a win-win."

"Not for all of you," Margaret muttered. "You get all the mess of a revolution and none of the change."

Amelia rubbed her face in desperation. "We could still get some change. She has to at least act like who she's promising to be, right?"

"Maybe." Charlie shrugged. "Maybe not. All she really needs to do is not be worse than Emerson. That's not a high bar." He nodded at Heather. "Plus, Marie Curie over here has an alternate theory." He grinned. "Is that not the perfect nickname?"

"Your attempts at humor are unpleasant."

"Oh, go drown in a lake. Tell them your theory."

"It is possible that the current mayor has intentionally artificially fortified actions of which the majority of the public disapproves."

"She was being shitty on purpose," Charlie explained. "Cooperating with Vogel to make us all hate her more."

"So, what, we should just forgive Tabitha?" Amelia spat. "This is still half her fault. At least."

Charlie squinted at her. "No one's talking about forgiving her. But right now, I think it makes sense for our primary target to be Vogel."

"Primary target? What, we're actually going to do something about this?"

"Of course, girl! If we wait until she's in power, we won't have a chance."

"Oh." Amelia blinked and leaned back, lightheaded. It was all too much to handle. "So... what are you thinking? Do we contact Kate and Travis somehow?"

Charlie and Ben exchanged glances. "Kate and Travis are locked up, according to Damien. Word got out *very* fast."

"I thought you said they got back with the gun."

"They did. Vogel threw them in a cell immediately."

"*What?* Why?"

"Probably because she was afraid they'd talked to me," Ben muttered. "Apparently that's enough of a risk that she'd rather have the whole Resistance talking about where they went."

"So we don't have people on the inside anymore, but Kate never would have believed this anyway." Charlie shrugged. "You ask me, it'll be easier without her. Now, you wanna hear the plans we've come up with?"

Amelia ran her hands tiredly through her hair. "I just --- I need to rest right now. I'm sorry."

Charlie barely stopped himself from diving into a plan and drew back a little. "No, sure. No problem. We'll come back later. Let's all head back upstairs. Go ahead, you guys, I'll be there in a minute."

Ben left reluctantly, Heather following him, and then it was just Charlie standing by her bed. Amelia looked up at him.

"Are you okay, girl? I know this is big news, but you just need some time to process. So did I."

"I'm fine," she snapped, harsher than she would have liked. "I'm fine. I just need to sleep."

"Alright," he said, still looking skeptical. "Then I won't stop you." He turned and left up the stairs, and Amelia stared at them after he had left.

"That's a shitty situation you're in," Margaret said after a while. "Can't be easy."

Amelia grunted. She lay back on the bed and stared up at the ceiling, trying to let go of the thoughts of Vogel, the Resistance, her family, and Tabitha, Tabitha, Tabitha.

She didn't sleep a wink.
