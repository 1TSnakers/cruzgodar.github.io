	Ben stepped up to the gate, shaking as if he were out in the cold already. At least he had Heather with him, both of them bundled tight in what looked like ten layers. He held the Cupid Bow like a life force.
	
	She gave him an appraising look. &#x201C;You will receive no further chances to return.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I know.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Then we move.&#x201D;
	
	The gate opened when Heather gave a glance to the camera, and before she stepped in, she stopped and seemed to focus, and Ben&#x2019;s watch vibrated momentarily. Then she stepped through the entrance, Ben following her in. The room was wide and tall but so narrow it still felt cramped, barely big enough to accommodate the two of them, a tiny waiting bench, and the guard behind the glass pane.
	
	&#x201C;Names?&#x201D; she asked crisply.
	
	&#x201C;I am Athene Harlie.&#x201D;
	
	The guard wrote that down, waited a moment, then glanced back up, annoyed. &#x201C;And?&#x201D; She gestured at Ben.
	
	&#x201C;And my companion is Benjamin Parkington.&#x201D;
	
	The guard blinked, then stood up sharply, her hand reaching for a holstered rubigun&mdash;
	
	Heather lunged forward, smashing through the glass with a fist and grabbing the guard&#x2019;s neck even as she tried to duck, and then yanking her out through the shattered window with one arm, using the same liquid motion and inhuman strength Ben had come to rely on. Heather tossed the guard headfirst to the floor as if she weighed nothing, and the woman landed on her face with a small crunch, a pool of red spreading out.
	
	Ben stared as Heather vaulted over the counter through the remnants of a window and picked up a microphone. &#x201C;Athene Harlie and Smith Human, out twenty-four hours. Clear to open.&#x201D; It was a perfect imitation of the guard&#x2019;s voice.
	
	Motors whirred, and the door they&#x2019;d walked through began to close and the inner gate started to open, despite four cameras pointing at them from every corner. Little arcs of electricity sputtered around a few of them.
	
	Ben&#x2019;s jaw worked. &#x201C;Is she going to be alright?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Would you prefer I killed her? Your father and the government will discover we have left regardless.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;No!&#x201D; he said quickly, half shouting. &#x201C;No. But we can&#x2019;t leave her like this.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;That is exactly what we will do.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not just letting her bleed out.&#x201D;
	
	Heather stared at him with green eyes. As he watched, her pupils constricted as if she&#x2019;d walked out into the sun, though the lighting in the room hadn&#x2019;t changed. &#x201C;The woman you seem to care for has sustained a broken nose. She may also have a concussion, though that is difficult to know for certain. Your concern is misplaced. Do you wish me to sound an alarm? Then we would be chased through the streets. Someone will find her, and she will receive care. Do not broker further argument in a matter in which you are ignorant.&#x201D;
	
	Ben steamed. No one talked to him like that &mdash; except maybe his father, and even then he barely took it.
	
	&#x201C;Put her back inside the dome.&#x201D;
	
	Heather&#x2019;s gaze hadn&#x2019;t left him, but now it sharpened. She kept silent.
	
	&#x201C;Do it.&#x201D; He gestured at the closing door, now with only a few feet left. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s going to die in here. If she&#x2019;s out there, someone will find her faster. It&#x2019;s the right thing to do.&#x201D;
	
	Heather stared at him.
	
	&#x201C;And I won&#x2019;t tell you what I know if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;You would put us in danger to expedite treatment that is less than necessary.&#x201D;
	
	Ben looked from her to the swiftly closing door, and groaned. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know why I put up with you.&#x201D; He bent down and dragged the unconscious guard by her feet toward the outer gate, hoping it wasn&#x2019;t through too many pieces of broken glass. The gap was two feet wide now, if that, and she barely fit through. Her shoulders dragged against the sides, and Ben pulled harder, finally unsticking them. Then her head was through, and Ben was running back at the gate, turning sideways and barely squeezing through with the clothes he had on. The steel doors shut behind him with a click, and he stared in disbelief at Heather. &#x201C;Could you really not have opened that door back up?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I was not part of what transpired.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;No, clearly you weren&#x2019;t.&#x201D; More motors spun up, the inner gate closed, trapping them in the airlock, and the temperature in the room dropped abruptly. He had barely been strong enough to drag the guard, and he was sweating all over, but now the heat was being leeched from him, faster and faster. Heather seemed unperturbed.
	
	Ben waited, thinking that it <em>had</em> to be finished any moment. Every second brought the coldest cold he&#x2019;d ever felt, and the thought of trekking miles in it made him want to curl up and hide. It stopped being cold after a while, becoming straight pain instead. Surrounding him, needling, scraping away. Worming its way through his clothes, which were decidedly not enough, and threatening to cripple him if he didn&#x2019;t move. He drew his two hoods up and cinched them both tight, any thoughts of being hot and sweaty forgotten.
	
	An eternity later, the final gate began to open with the same lethargy as the other two had, and Heather stepped forward.
	
	Ben looked at her and started. &#x201C;Your hand!&#x201D;
	
	Heather held it up, covered in gashes and wet with blood from where she&#x2019;d punched through the glass window. &#x201C;Of small importance,&#x201D; she said, pulling on gloves. &#x201C;The cold will help it clot.&#x201D; She talked over Ben&#x2019;s objection. &#x201C;The door is open. Let us move.&#x201D;
	
	Ben rubbed what little of his face still showed with mittened hands. It was already numb.
	
	&#x201C;Alright,&#x201D; he murmured. Heather gave no indication she&#x2019;d heard.
	
	They walked out into the night.

	As though Melissa&#x2019;s body were toxic, Amelia found herself more and more awake the farther away she was, though reality was still safely blurred behind a layer of fog.
	
	Kate ran straight for the other end of the short hallway, then backpedaled wildly as a slew of guards poured out around it, drawing guns. One went down from a stray bullet coming from behind the three rebels.
	
	And there were more following them. As loud as the first had been, leaving her ears ringing and her head in pain, the rest were muffled, more like little <em>pops</em> than massive explosions. None of it felt real. She barely noticed when Kate pulled them through the doorway to the stairwell and slammed the door behind them, didn&#x2019;t realize how lucky they were that Melissa hadn&#x2019;t closed it, and didn&#x2019;t register what Kate was doing when she took quick, stomping steps toward the underside of the stairs before shoving all of them underneath.
	
	Amelia did notice, though, when the lights turned blood red and pulsing, and a siren pierced into the mute babble of her thoughts. She opened her mouth, less to speak than to moan, and Kate clamped a hand over it immediately. Then the door burst open and the sound of a herd of guards trampling their way up the stairs filled the room. Amelia made to get up, but Kate pressed her back down, hand still over her mouth. She drew her rubigun with her other hand, slowly.
	
	A second passed, then two, then ten. Amelia couldn&#x2019;t hear her own breathing for the pounding in her ears. The blood on her face and ears was drying, dripping a little as it mingled with sweat and somehow becoming even worse. The three of them were crowded together in the tiny space under the stairs, and Amelia could hear nothing but three sets of breaths.
	
	And then, above them, the sound of footsteps coming back down the stairs.
	
	Kate slowly removed her hand so that she could hold the rubigun with two. The footsteps grew quieter, and then Amelia couldn&#x2019;t hear them at all. She waited for the guard to flash out in front of them, gun raised. She didn&#x2019;t feel afraid of it, but then she didn&#x2019;t feel much of anything.
	
	No guard appeared, but Kate pulled the trigger anyway, sending a blast of flame straight out. Before it could even hit the wall, she had pushed away from Amelia and Travis, launching out from under the staircase. She turned and fired, and there was a man&#x2019;s scream, brief and blood-curdling. Then Kate landed and the wall was smoking, and when Amelia and Travis crawled numbly out, they saw a guard lying face-up on the ground, face red and blistered. Kate was breathing raggedly.
	
	Amelia stared at him as Kate picked up his gun and walked to the door, motioning for them to follow. She&#x2019;d only seen the guard for an instant, but she knew without a doubt that this was the one who had killed Melissa. <em>Killed Melissa</em> rang in her mind like a deafening bell until she squeezed her eyes shut and clenched her fists and it receded. She wanted to kick the guard, unconscious or not. Do a lot more than kick, but that would be a start.
	
	&#x201C;<em>Amelia!</em>&#x201D; Kate hissed. &#x201C;Get over here!&#x201D;
	
	She grimaced and tore herself away, joining Kate and Travis by the door. Travis looked vacant, staring blankly up the stairs. Kate&#x2019;s face was set, but it was shaky. She nodded and opened the door, rushing back out into the hallway.
	
	Or tried to. Instead she just leaned into the door and grunted as if it had knocked the breath from her. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s locked.&#x201D;
	
	Amelia had already been visualizing being back out in the cold dark, where she was invisible, and the slow understanding of what Kate had said tore that relief from her like a bandage, leaving her trembling. They only had one way to go.
	
	Kate let out a shaky breath. &#x201C;Come on. We can&#x2019;t wait here.&#x201D; She started down the stairs.
	
	Amelia took two steps after her, then glanced down at the guard. Something flared up within her, and she kicked him in the ribs. Again. And again. Neither Kate nor Travis said a word. When she staggered back, the fire had dwindled, and it left clarity. Horror and grief and an anger that ran deeper, but clarity.
	
	She marched down the stairs, unholstering her rubigun.

	&#x201C;I was under the impression that you were a diplomat.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201D; Ben muttered through chattering teeth. He&#x2019;d let Heather hold the bow, and now she kept an arrow nocked while they walked.
	
	&#x201C;A third person would have proven useful. It is unfortunate you could not convince your friend to join us.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not friends.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I do not understand the arbitrary distinctions of friendships.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t say.&#x201D;

	Lucas squinted from his chair. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re Amelia&#x2019;s friend.&#x201D; Ben nodded. &#x201C;Boyfriend?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;No.&#x201D;
	
	He barked a laugh. &#x201C;At least you&#x2019;re honest.&#x201D; Ben&#x2019;s lip curled, but he kept his mouth shut, and Lucas continued. &#x201C;So, are you gonna tell me where she is?&#x201D;
	
	Ben chose his words carefully. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s going after her brother.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;She&#x2019;s going after Nate. And where does she think Nate is?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;In a prison outside.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Really.&#x201D; His face betrayed nothing. &#x201C;How does she know that?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Then why are you here?&#x201D; Lucas asked, biting off the words. It didn&#x2019;t take special training to see he was seething under the surface. He stood up abruptly from the chair and started to pace through the mess toward the kitchen counter, his back to Ben.
	
	He&#x2019;d barely had time to look around, but now Ben couldn&#x2019;t ignore the shards of broken glass on the floor, the dirty bowls and plates on the flat surfaces, and the papers strewn everywhere, as if Lucas had torn apart a textbook. He glanced at a few and understood nothing more than legal jargon. Most had Nate&#x2019;s name in their titles.
	
	&#x201C;So?&#x201D; Lucas turned back around, a glass of water in a hand that wasn&#x2019;t quite steady. &#x201C;Why are you here?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Because I&#x2019;m going after Amelia, and I think you should come with me.&#x201D;
	
	Lucas nodded, took a drink and grimaced. Maybe not water after all. &#x201C;You want to stop her.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I want to <em>help</em> her. I think she&#x2019;s in danger.&#x201D; Maybe not technically true, but it served his purpose. &#x201C;At first I thought I could get to her before she left, but I wasn&#x2019;t prepared, and she moved faster than I expected.&#x201D;
	
	Lucas took another drink, rolling it around his mouth. &#x201C;Amelia is in the Resistance.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I know.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;You know.&#x201D; Lucas stared at his glass. &#x201C;So you&#x2019;re in the Resistance too, then?&#x201D;
	
	Ben started to say <em>of course not</em>, but stumbled.
	
	Lucas just nodded. &#x201C;Okay.&#x201D; He looked back up at Ben. &#x201C;So let me be very clear. <em>Amelia</em> started this. <em>Amelia</em> is why Nate&#x2019;s gone. If she wants to go die outside, if she&#x2019;s really &#x2018;in danger&#x2019;, that&#x2019;s easier for me.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;But she&#x2019;s your&mdash;&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Shut<em> </em>up. I don&#x2019;t care where she is or what she&#x2019;s doing. If Nate&#x2019;s really locked up out there, then nothing she can do will help. <em>I&#x2019;m</em> his only hope.&#x201D;
	
	Ben blinked.
	
	&#x201C;So, do you think you can be a good errand boy and run that back to your boss?&#x201D;
	
	It took everything he had not to turn and bolt. &#x201C;If you won&#x2019;t go for Amelia, will you go for Nate?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;<em>What?</em>&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you think you owe it to him?&#x201D;
	
	Lucas hurled the glass at him. Petrified, Ben could only stare as it flew toward him and missed entirely, shattering against the front wall and flecking the back of his head with alcohol and bits of broken glass.
	
	&#x201C;Do <em>not</em> talk to me about what I owe.&#x201D; Lucas&#x2019;s face matched what had become of his glass. &#x201C;Get the fuck out of my house.&#x201D;
	
	This time, Ben was all too happy to comply.

	They raced down the stairs through the throbbing alarm lights to the first floor &mdash; also locked. Heart pounding, Amelia followed Kate back to the second floor to get the unconscious guard&#x2019;s keys, hearing her curse the whole way for not thinking of them. They started to open the second-floor door, but a troupe of guards marching up from below stopped that plan. Kate shot the first one with a rubigun before bolting up the stairs, Amelia and Travis in tow.
	
	Amelia was already exhausted &mdash; the sheer weight of her clothes made running ten feet a hard task, and bounding up the stairs like an excited dog &mdash; or a hungry one &mdash; was wearing her out. Still, she didn&#x2019;t once stop.
	
	Kate had the keys in her hand, but there wasn&#x2019;t enough time to stop and try all of them on the locked third-floor door. They kept going, looking for an unlocked one.
	
	&#x201C;How are we getting out of here?&#x201D; Travis half-shouted. He got no answer.
	
	Up to the fourth floor &mdash; also locked &mdash; and then up again. Kate stopped so abruptly on the fifth that Amelia ran straight into her, almost knocking her over. She started to say something, but Kate shushed her, and she kept quiet.
	
	And then she heard it &mdash; the footsteps coming from above, mixing with those from below.
	
	Kate sprung into action like a fox. &#x201C;Keep them away.&#x201D; She started jamming keys into the door, trying one after another of what had to be two dozen.
	
	Amelia swallowed and looked at Travis, gesturing at the stairs down. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll take this side.&#x201D; A small voice in the back of her mind wondered absently how she was still functioning.
	
	Travis nodded and planted his feet in front of the other stairs, staring up. The sounds of jingling keys and plodding footsteps filled the small space.
	
	Amelia caught a glimpse of something moving and fired on impulse, sending a plume of purple flame roaring up. She thought she heard a voice swearing. Travis fired behind her, and she definitely heard shouts.
	
	The flame was quickly dying where Amelia had shot it, and she fired another, but a guard darted out across the landing and under the fireball before it could hit him. He stood up quickly and pointed a ballistic gun at her. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t move.&#x201D;
	
	Amelia stared at him, still holding her rubigun that could light him on fire a hundred times slower than he could shoot through her head. She lowered the gun, slowly.
	
	Behind her, Amelia heard the sound of a lock turning. She fought the urge to look.
	
	&#x201C;Good,&#x201D; the guard was saying, his gun still trained on her head. &#x201C;No sudden movements, now, okay? Just put that rubigun on the ground. Same goes for all of you.&#x201D;
	
	Amelia did as she was told, if slowly. Two clinks from behind told her Travis and Kate had too.
	
	&#x201C;Very good,&#x201D; the guard said soothingly. &#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re going to come up there and talk about this.&#x201D; He said <em>we</em>, but Amelia saw no one else.
	
	One step up the stairs. Two. Three.
	
	Then in a blur, there was another explosion that left Amelia&#x2019;s ears ringing, and the guard was falling back, his head &mdash; Amelia didn&#x2019;t want to look at his head, shot through like Melissa&#x2019;s with a real bullet. And that was just as well, because this time Kate wasn&#x2019;t pulling her anywhere &mdash; she had her hands full with the door. She fell into the adjacent room, and Travis and Amelia fell with her, even as gunfire exploded from guards both above and below them. Then they were inside, and it was dark, and Kate was scrambling to shut the door and lock it, and they took off running. Amelia&#x2019;s ears rang from the noise &mdash; she&#x2019;d forgotten Kate had even taken the first guard&#x2019;s gun at all.
	
	No one spoke for a moment. They only had seconds before the guards found the right key themselves and burst in after them.
	
	Then the voices started.
	
	&#x201C;Help!&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Let us out!&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;How did you get out?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;<em>Help!</em>&#x201D;
	
	Amelia glanced around in the gloom and saw hands behind windows, pounding and pleading. It hurt when she&#x2019;d thought she couldn&#x2019;t feel any more.
	
	&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D; she yelled, only realizing she was sobbing when she heard her own voice. The others didn&#x2019;t stop. A chorus of <em>help</em> and <em>save us</em> and vile curses followed her down the hallway.
	
	And among them, barely audible in the drone, a small voice.
	
	&#x201C;Amelia?&#x201D;

	Ben had time to think in the two hours it took them to reach the outskirts of the city, but just barely.
	
	&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s <em>go!</em>&#x201D; He pushed Heather forward, walking as fast as he could without running. &#x201C;We have to catch them as close to the prison as we can so they don&#x2019;t have time to get far.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Do not touch me.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Then walk faster. Did you forget about the police that are supposed to be coming after us right now?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;We will be seen as potential targets with a higher velocity.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t <em>care</em>.&#x201D; Ben ground his teeth and tried to remember what his face felt like. &#x201C;This is pointless if we don&#x2019;t make it in time. Besides, we&#x2019;re not targets when you have that.&#x201D; He gestured at the Cupid Bow. She started to draw back the arrow whenever anyone looked at them for longer than a second.
	
	Heather kept silent, and Ben couldn&#x2019;t help but groan. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re so worried about us being seen, why don&#x2019;t you just cover us in robots again?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;My supply was emptied when we infiltrated the Watchtower.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Well, at least we&#x2019;re not going inside the prison.&#x201D; He glared at her. &#x201C;So can we <em>please</em> go faster?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Perhaps you should not have durated so long with your acts of charity.&#x201D;
	
	Ben stepped in front of her and stopped, but Heather just walked liquidly past him, and he had to catch up and talk from behind. &#x201C;<em>Durated?</em> What are you <em>talking</em> about?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;From the word <em>duration.</em> It appears you cannot speak your own language.&#x201D;
	
	Ben clenched his teeth and tried not to scream. &#x201C;Lucas deserved to at least know where Amelia <em>is</em>. I didn&#x2019;t have a choice. <em>You</em> have a choice, and&#x201D; &mdash; he shook his head &mdash; &#x201C;and I&#x2019;m making it for you. Either keep up or let me go and never learn the truth.&#x201D; Ben sped up, leaving Heather behind. He was overplaying his hand, and he knew it &mdash; Heather wouldn&#x2019;t chase this promise of truth forever, even if it was an honest one &mdash; but after a minute, she joined him, her hypersmooth gait giving her the impression of a clay figurine.
	
	The streets were uncomfortably full. Ben had expected a ghost town, sprinkled with killers and thieves that hid from sight until they were ready to strike. They did see a handful of those, jumping out of buildings with a rubigun or sneaking up from behind with a knife, taking money or drugs or matches. Heather never did anything, and Ben was too afraid to say otherwise. But for the most part, the streets of the Los Angeles outside were not so much dangerous as they were <em>tense</em>. People milled nervously, talking in twos and threes and glancing furtively around. Ben caught no more than the occasional word, but <em>Resistance</em> was in there regularly, and with nothing else to do, he began to wonder why.
	
	He heard dissent, but most of the time the word was in a tone he recognized as reverential. So the outliers were waiting for the Resistance to make a move. He&#x2019;d heard enough of Vogel&#x2019;s announcement over the loudspeaker to know there was a big move coming &mdash; the question was just what it had to do with the outliers.
	
	And the answer there was obvious enough, too &mdash; Vogel would let them inside in exchange for their support. But she was working for Emerson, who wanted nothing less than her city full of the people. What was the point of promising them entry if in the end, she wasn&#x2019;t going to give it to them?
	
	Or &mdash; no, it wasn&#x2019;t quite that simple, was it? If Vogel was just reporting to Emerson, she wouldn&#x2019;t need outside support &mdash; especially not this kind of outside support. She could just collect all the recruits together for a final offensive, have them arrested, and take her promotion from the mayor. But that couldn&#x2019;t be the plan, or the Resistance wouldn&#x2019;t have been around for six years when six months would have worked just as well. No, Vogel was really doing this. She was really planning to take Tabitha down, and so of course she needed massive support if she didn&#x2019;t want the richest in the city to throw her out of office the moment she sat down.
	
	Ben rubbed his forehead. That still didn&#x2019;t explain why the mayor was cooperating with the woman conspiring to take her down. Unless she was forced to, but there were so many things wrong with that. If Vogel wanted a gun, she was either trying to kill Emerson or look like it, and if she had her on strings, she could just make her step down and either declare Vogel the mayor or rig an election. Then Vogel would have a peaceful transition into power, and it would have taken a lot less than six years. And if she really believed in a more liberal leadership, she could have made the mayor cut ties with and sabotage the upper class backing her up.
	
	No, it didn&#x2019;t make any sense. Ben racked his head, trying to find an explanation that fit, but nothing came closer than the one he had, and he wasn&#x2019;t convinced of it.
	
	But then he saw the prison, and Ben didn&#x2019;t think another thing about Vogel.

	&#x201C;Nate!&#x201D; Amelia screamed, skidding to a halt and turning back, racing through the dark corridor. None of the faces that leered at her from behind tiny windows looked anything like her brother.
	
	&#x201C;No no no what are you <em>doing?</em>&#x201D; Kate&#x2019;s voice rose in pitch for the first time since they&#x2019;d stepped inside the prison. &#x201C;<em>Amelia!</em>&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Give me the keys! It&#x2019;s <em>him!</em>&#x201D; Her breathing was strained and ragged. &#x201C;<em>Nate!</em> Where are you?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Here! I&#x2019;m right here!&#x201D;
	
	Amelia snapped her head around and darted toward the voice. Sure enough, through the window in the door to cell 506, Amelia could see a grimy face in the dark. She didn&#x2019;t have time to gasp at how he looked. Instead, she turned around to take the keys from Kate and saw her not three but thirty feet away, frozen.
	
	&#x201C;<em>Get over here!</em>&#x201D; Amelia roared.
	
	Kate&#x2019;s gaze darted between her and the door they&#x2019;d come through, the one Amelia refused to think about. After a tense moment, she scowled and swore violently but sprinted back to Amelia, Travis nervously in tow. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have time for this!&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Shut up,&#x201D; she spat. &#x201C;Nate? Just hold on. We&#x2019;re gonna get you outta here.&#x201D; Her brother&#x2019;s eyes were wide, and he looked back and forth between the two of them in confusion. Kate thrust the keys at Travis, and he started trying them in rapid succession, not bothering to make sure he gave each one a fair chance. Kate stood and stared at the door, the gun in her hands not shaking. Much.
	
	&#x201C;Got it!&#x201D; called Travis, and Amelia heard the lock click and the door swing open, and then Nate was rushing into her embrace, and she could see him clearly for the first time. It had only been a day since he was gone, but he looked as bad as he had when they&#x2019;d briefly been on their own after their father died. His cheekbones were pronounced, his hair a ratty mess, his eyes glazed. His face was streaked with tears, and it took all Amelia had to let him go.
	
	&#x201C;Hurry <em>up</em>,&#x201D; Kate growled, pulling all three of them forward. Nate stumbled into a run, trying to keep up, and they started toward the far side of the floor where the other staircase was. The voices doubled in volume when they realized no one else was getting out, and Amelia felt like she was in the middle of a madhouse.
	
	&#x201C;Come <em>on!</em>&#x201D; Kate shot nervous glances back every two seconds, hustling them along. The corridor wasn&#x2019;t that long &mdash; fifty cells at the most. The far door was right there, if they could just get to it.
	
	It was no more than ten seconds before the door behind them burst open and there were guards on their tail. Amelia hadn&#x2019;t thought Nate&#x2019;s eyes could get any wider. But they had a lead, and the end was closing in. Twenty cells away. Ten. Five&mdash;
	
	And then the door made a <em>click</em>. Kate got there and struggled with it and snatched the keys out of Travis&#x2019;s hand, but it was too late. The guards were on top of them.
	
	&#x201C;Drop your weapon!&#x201D; one shouted. &#x201C;Drop it now!&#x201D; Kate waited for them to yell it again, then withdrew herself slowly from the door, turned around, and set down the gun, her face drawn tight. When she stood up and all four of them had raised their hands, one guard pushed through to the front, stumbling &mdash; the one who had killed Melissa. His face was beet red, scarred from the rubigun blast to the face, and his eyes looked past them all. He was blind, or close to it.
	
	They stood there, facing each other in the bloody light. Amelia stepped forward to tell the guard what she thought of him, but Kate beat her there.
	
	&#x201C;You miserable wretch,&#x201D; she spat, sneering. &#x201C;You deserve a lot more than being blind. If I had two minutes alone with you... god, I would tear you into little strips.&#x201D; Amelia&#x2019;s gaze snapped from the guard to her. &#x201C;Melissa was the only good thing that ever happened to me. The <em>only thing.</em>&#x201D; She heaved a breath. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not done with you. Understand? I am going to find you, cut you up, and feed you the pieces.&#x201D;
	
	Her voice had dropped dangerously low by the end, and Amelia glanced at Travis, who had the same concerned look she did. Amelia opened her mouth, but he shook his head at her. Nate just stayed as close to Amelia as he could, holding onto her arm and quivering.
	
	The blind guard made a rasping noise that could have been a laugh and raised his rubigun at Kate. Nate gasped and skittered back, and in a flash, the guard grinned with a raw mouth and flicked the gun toward him. Amelia shouted, and instinct took over. She barely managed to step in front of Nate and hold up her hands before the guard pulled the trigger. The plasma hit, searing her hands through the thin gloves she hadn&#x2019;t taken off, and she dropped to her knees. The tranquilizer would absorb slower than it would on bare skin, but she could already feel herself slipping away.
	
	&#x201C;Yep,&#x201D; one of the guards muttered. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the one. Brown hair, brown eyes. How&#x2019;d you screw it up the first time, Derek?&#x201D;
	
	The blind guard coughed. &#x201C;The commander looks the same,&#x201D; he rasped.
	
	&#x201C;S&#x2019;all good, man. Don&#x2019;t sweat it.&#x201D; The first guard led Derek up to Amelia. &#x201C;Here, you do the honors.&#x201D; He unholstered his gun and handed it to Derek, helping him guide it toward Amelia&#x2019;s head.
	
	Amelia watched it in numb detachment. The pain in her hands vanished, and her world shrunk to the ballistic weapon drawing closer to her head.
	
	The row of cells had gone silent, and when a ringing came from the first guard&#x2019;s pocket, it cut through like a shard of glass. He pulled out what looked like a walkie-talkie and held it to his ear. &#x201C;Sup?&#x201D; He laughed. &#x201C;Man, since when do I get any calls?&#x201D; His laugh died on his face, though. &#x201C;Oh. I don&#x2019;t &mdash; um, yeah, route her through.&#x201D; He swallowed. Derek had stopped with the gun a few inches from Amelia and was turned toward the conversation. Amelia waited and felt every drop of sweat down her neck.
	
	&#x201C;Hello, ma&#x2019;am. I &mdash; yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201D; The guard was sweating a little himself. &#x201C;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. We killed one of the intruders. The sergeant, ma&#x2019;am. But I &mdash; yes, ma&#x2019;am, it does go against protocol.&#x201D; He swallowed again. &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t happen again. Thank you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201D; He returned the walkie-talkie to his pocket with a shaky hand and looked at Derek. &#x201C;No killing. Orders all the way from the top.&#x201D;
	
	Derek grimaced but nodded. &#x201C;Fine. Think I can still knock her out?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see why not.&#x201D;
	
	The last thing Amelia saw was Nate&#x2019;s horrified expression. Then the butt of the gun slammed into her head, and the world grew blacker still.

	&#x201C;No further.&#x201D;
	
	Ben was happy to comply, bending over and panting for breath. Any more and they&#x2019;d be out in the open, in clear sight from the prison. As it was, he could see where the asphalt gave way to grass, replete with footprints. He understood why they were still there after a moment, and shuddered in the middle of heaving breaths. This was everyone who had ever walked there since Umbra.
	
	Heather glanced around. &#x201C;Here.&#x201D; She set off for a building that somehow looked more abandoned than the ones around it, and Ben reluctantly followed. Every window was covered in duct tape, like some panicked attempt at an airlock.
	
	Ben&#x2019;s instincts told him it would be warmer inside, but the air was just as cold and just as still. The door wasn&#x2019;t even locked, and Heather moved in quickly, rubigun drawn, before stepping further inside. Ben followed her as she swept the ground floor, marveling at the sight. It was almost too dark to see a thing, but in the faint light of the stars, he could make out the shape of debris covering every bit of the floor. Scraps of paper, rusty metal, and above all, broken glass. Every cupboard was thrown open and empty, every drawer off its hinges. The only items the house had to offer were lying on the floor, and they were paltry at best. Heather took to the stairs after a cursory search of the ground floor, and Ben trusted her that no one was there &mdash; it was hard to imagine a home less lived-in.
	
	The upper floor was much smaller &mdash; a bathroom and a bedroom, or so Ben guessed. A porcelain stump stood in the bathroom, filled with jagged, bent pieces of copper that could have been pipes. There were shards of mirror in the sink, but only tiny ones, and the rest of the room was dusted in a light sprinkling of chalky dust. The bathtub stood strangely intact, though the faucet was sawn off and the bottom was stained with a red somewhere between copper and blood.
	
	The bedroom wasn&#x2019;t as much of an abstract horror scene. There was a discolored rectangle where a bed might have been, and not much more. Heather checked the closet before making her way to the window. Peeling away some of the duct tape, she stared out at the prison, and Ben crouched down with her and tore a hole in the tape for himself. The massive building was quiet and still, and for a long time, Heather was too. Ben couldn&#x2019;t help but fidget after twenty minutes went by &mdash; he wished he had Mr. Lipcott&#x2019;s monocular, or just any way to make out the prison better than by the starlight. He had to strain his eyes to make out anything, and it was all so blurry that it didn&#x2019;t help when he did.
	
	He sighed eventually. &#x201C;We must be too late. This was a terrible id&mdash;&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Cease.&#x201D; Heather didn&#x2019;t move, just kept staring. After what felt like another hour, she sat back like a retracting machine.
	
	Ben couldn&#x2019;t wait. &#x201C;Well?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;There is an anomaly on the second-floor entrance near the hill.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;What kind of anomaly?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;The grass is lightly scorched and the door has retained severe fire damage. It is missing a large amount of substance and contains embers.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;The grass is lightly scorched,&#x201D; Ben deadpanned. &#x201C;How could you <em>possibly</em> see that.&#x201D; He shook his head. &#x201C;Actually, never&mdash;&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Simulated long exposure with controlled retinal agitations to remove noise.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Fine. So they burned their way in?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;That is a reasonable assumption.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;But&mdash;&#x201D; Ben rubbed his face. &#x201C;But that doesn&#x2019;t tell us anything. So they burned through the door, stole a gun, and left. How is that important?&#x201D;
	
	Heather stared at the gap she&#x2019;d torn. &#x201C;Did you understand the papers concerning this prison?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;What, did <em>you?</em> There were hundreds of those!&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Section 947.5: The Emergency Alarm System shall be activated in the event of a class 5 emergency or higher. Section 947.6: The Emergency Alarm System shall be deactivated immediately when there are no ongoing emergencies of class 5 or higher. Section 180.17: In the event an unauthorized person or persons obtains access to any location within the building boundaries, a class 7 emergency shall be initiated. Section 180.18: An emergency initiated on account of the unauthorized entrance of a person or persons within the boundary walls shall not be ended until the persons are either detained and determined to pose no threat or determined to no longer be within one mile of the building boundary. Section 504.2: In the event of a breach to the building boundaries that results in a continuous drop in inside air temperature, a class 4 emergency shall be initiated.&#x201D;
	
	Ben almost snapped at Heather to speak English, but he&#x2019;d done that enough times with no result, so he just closed his eyes and thought. And after a minute, he thought he understood. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a hole in the door?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Correct.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;And the emergency system has lights?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Red lights.&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;And... they&#x2019;re supposed to deal with the highest class emergencies first?&#x201D;
	
	&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;
	
	Ben nodded slowly. &#x201C;So the Resistance broke in and set off the alarm. Now the lights are off, because you can&#x2019;t see them through the hole in the door, and the people here haven&#x2019;t fixed that hole yet, so they&#x2019;re still busy with the bigger emergency. But the lights are off, so that emergency&#x2019;s over now. And if the Resistance were a mile away, they&#x2019;d have had time to patch the hole, or at least guards would be out looking.&#x201D;
	
	Heather just stared at him, and if Ben didn&#x2019;t know better, he&#x2019;d have thought she almost looked proud. &#x201C;Exactly.&#x201D;
	
	But when the smugness faded, Ben had to face what it all meant. He swallowed and looked back out at the prison. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re still in there.&#x201D;
