# VIII: Hid Men

### nav-buttons



The three of them sat in an uneasy truce around the breakfast table, the sun barely providing enough light to see by. It didn't come close to reaching their window at this hour, and it gave barely any heat. Not that it was what heated the city at all anymore, but still --- the room was too cold, even for the end of fall.

They were silent, eating real bread and artificial jam --- one item courtesy of Amelia and the other of Lucas --- until Nate's insistent looks became too much.

"Plans today?" Amelia asked around a mouthful, already reaching for more. She ignored the knife Lucas pushed toward her and tore off a chunk instead, dipping one end in the jam.

Nate shook his head. "Same as usual."

Lucas picked up the knife himself and set to work carving off a half-ragged slice of bread. "Any of your friends got ideas for places to look?"

Any glimmer of excitement in Nate's eyes dimmed. "Nope."

Amelia tensed, ready for him to say more, but he just reached for more bread. She wasn't about to bring it up with him, but she'd only seen one other person around Nate for nearly a year --- Tommy.

"Have some jam," Lucas was saying. "It's good for you."

"It tastes funny."

"It tastes like blackberries!"

Nate finished off his pull of bread and pushed his chair away from the table. "I think I'm gonna head out."

"You have money for lunch?" At an offhand nod, Lucas swallowed. "You know, if you ever want to talk---"

"Why don't we all go ice skating sometime soon?" Amelia broke in.

Lucas shot her a glare. "I don't think we can---"

"It'll be fun. I'll make reservations today. We should be able to get in next month."

"Amelia---"

"Good." Her tone left no room for questions. "That'll be fun."

Nate gave her a look, and she couldn't tell for the life of her if it was thankful or resentful. Then he left, and it was just the two of them.

"You're not actually going to make a reservation."

Amelia shrugged and stood up, taking the plates to the sink to wash them and putting away the bread and jam. "You hear Tabitha banned matches?"

"I already threw all of ours away."

"And you're just okay with that? Isn't there any part of you that thinks that's ridiculous?"

"Amelia, I just..." Lucas sighed, longer than usual. "Yes. Of course it's ridiculous. No one thinks matches are the problem. I don't know why she's doing what she's doing, but I trust her. She's got a reason." He pushed himself to his feet. "I've gotta go to work, and you're gonna go do whatever it is you do on the weekends these days." He picked up a rumpled dress shirt thrown over the back of the couch and began to button it up. "Could you get some eggs on your way home?"

Amelia nodded. "Sure. Got five grand?"

"Don't pretend you're going to the store." He picked up his suitcase, the oldest and priciest part of his ensemble by far, and walked out.

Lucas often complained that their part of Los Angeles was rundown and dangerous, so close to the edge, but Amelia was fond of the area --- there was barely any crowd and barely any noise.

Apart from the obvious --- only five minutes had passed when she heard the crackle of old loudspeakers from above her.

"This is a reminder that ballistic firearms are strictly prohibited inside Los Angeles," a female voice pleasantly announced. "Possession of a firearm or ammunition is punishable by death on sight."

Amelia sighed and kept walking. No one had ever tried to bring a real gun into the city in years, not that they would have any reason to. Burning someone senseless with a rubigun and then knifing them was just as effective as a bullet.

She passed a rotten grocery, a butcher shop, a brothel, every one shadier than the last. Patrons kept to the shadows, wearing hoodies or other face-obscuring clothing. A few illicit substances were exchanged in her view, and she did her best to keep her eyes straight ahead.

She was walking past a bakery that looked somewhat less dangerous than its neighbors when a figure burst out of it, making a mad dash into the street with a bag in his hand. He had barely made it five steps when a *thrum* sounded from the bakery and a wave of purple fire washed over him before dissipating almost instantly. He dropped to the asphalt, writhing from the flash burns, and his bag was reclaimed by the shooter --- the aproned chef. Amelia kept moving.

The city babbled all around her --- quieter than the center, but now not by much. Bicycle-drawn rickshaws plowed through the streets, ferrying customers through the city. Toward the south, an glass structure shaped like a donut cut in half lengthwise marked the beginning of the farmland. It protected the hydroponic crops below from anyone foolish enough to actually try taking some. Guards were positioned every hundred feet at the border between concrete and machinery, in case the explosion-resistant strengthened glass weren't enough to deter potential thieves.

Amelia was nearly to the courtyard when she was almost knocked over. A woman wearing a balaclava barreled past her, a brown ponytail the only part of her that wasn't covered in black clothing. She shoved her way through the crowd, colliding with others, and moments later, two police officers sprinted out from a cross street directly in front of her, turning and chasing after their quarry.

"Stop, Resistance! We have you surrounded!"

Amelia's ears pricked up, and she quickened her pace to get a better view of the action, pushing a few people out of the way herself. The woman had drawn a rubigun and was taking hip shots at the police with little success. Fireballs arced high in the air, pluming where they landed. With a glance behind her, the woman holstered her gun and pulled a baseball-sized sphere from her belt. With a *pop* that even Amelia could hear, the woman opened the capsule, removing a massive chunk of gray metal. She lobbed it at the officers with a grunt and dashed away.

Amelia couldn't help but admire the two police in front of her. As the grenade flew through the air, already catching fire, both women immediately dropped to one knee and fired their rubiguns at the projectile. Some of the tiny pellets struck the larger chunk of rubidium, and the space above the middle of the street was suddenly filled with a massive but harmless ball of purple fire. It was gone just as quickly, though it took several moments for Amelia's eyes to recover from the blinding light they'd been exposed to. When she could see clearly, the Resistance woman was gone.

The crowds returned to normal before too long, as though nothing had happened, and Amelia eventually moved on too, reaching Charlie's courtyard barely on time.

Half a week had passed since she and Nate raided the Silver Dollar. Amelia was now actively looking for a job, but that was as hard as it had been when she was ten, if not harder. No one seemed to be hiring, and the few who were turned her away the moment she walked in the door with a complete lack of a resume.

She needed money.

Amelia had stopped disturbing Charlie, letting him emerge of his own volition. This time he was very late --- she'd almost given up and left --- but he had a grin on his face bigger than most she'd seen from him. His hair was matted and a little singed, and he had a serious-looking burn on one cheek, but he didn't seem to notice or care.

"I'm done!" He spread his arms magnificently, as though she knew remotely what he was building. "Took me a month, but I got out unscathed." He glanced at his arm, red and angry from whatever he was working with. "...well. Sorry to keep you, girl, but I just couldn't stop when I was that close to being done." His grin turned lopsided. "Hey, I don't smell so bad you feel like you're going to spontaneously throw up, do I?"

"Uh... no?"

"Then it's a success! Just in time, too."

Charlie was even more energetic than usual, and he barely let her catch her breath between exercises. He scarfed his food even faster than usual, cold as it was, and was feverish in his teaching.

Of all the things she learned, the one Charlie impressed upon her the most was breaking free from pins. He would grab her wrists from behind, and she would twist them in precise ways to break free.

"Not so fast," he said at one point, despite moving, talking and teaching faster than usual. "There's no rush to this. Sometimes you'll want to wait an hour before you try to break free."

Amelia snorted. "An hour? When would you ever want to wait?"

Charlie shook his head. "You kids and your instant gratification. Back in my day, we waited days to break free from pins."

Breaking free was only the beginning, though, and after three grueling hours, Charlie dropped onto a bench, breathing a little heavy. He looked up at Amelia and grinned. "Alright! I think that about does it."

She was dripping with sweat, so exhausted she was slow to understand his meaning. "What, we're *done?* You haven't even taught me how to attack yet!"

"And I'm not going to. Didn't we talk about this? You don't need to attack people --- just get 'em angry and let them come at you."

Amelia squinted at him. "Do you want me gone?"

Charlie opened his mouth, probably to bite off a retort, but then closed it and sighed. "No. But I have some things that are going to take up some more time now, after... that." He gestured vaguely toward the cellar."

Amelia swallowed. She could connect those dots.

Charlie looked at her, face drawn. "You ever take that offer?" She shook her head, and he studied her. "You're good, you know. Really good. You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago." His expression hardened ever so slightly. "Do your homework. Practice your rolls. For the love of god, keep your arms out."

Amelia nodded. And after a second's thought, she hugged him, too. It took him a moment, but he hugged back.

It only lasted a moment, and then she was picking up her backpack and starting to leave. "Think you'll still have time for breakfast sometimes?"

Charlie smiled. "If you're offering, I'm accepting. A man's gotta eat."



<p class="body-text" style="text-align: center">- - -</p>



Amelia walked home in a daze, stopping only briefly to pick up some eggs. No more training with Charlie, and no more job either --- she had no idea what was supposed to fill her days.

She almost didn't recognize the apartment --- there were two burly men out in front. And---

She was yanked behind a wall with sudden force, a hand clamped around her mouth. She tried to scream for only a moment before she realized it was Lucas, eyes wild as a horse's. He took his hand away.

"They got here this morning," he said. "Right after you left. I came back because I forgot my ID card and they were right there."

He swallowed. "I don't know where Nate is."
