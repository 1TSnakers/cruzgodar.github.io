But when she runs face-first into an old homeless man with a secret project and a mastery of martial arts &mdash; and he agrees to teach her &mdash; she starts to grow stronger, though with that strength comes distance from her family. As she struggles to keep old secrets under wraps, Amelia discovers the forces operating against the city and the insurgency at the heart of it all.</p>

It&#x2019;s stifling, and when his sixteenth birthday comes and goes without a glimpse of the outside world, he reaches a breaking point. But being the son of an oligarch isn&#x2019;t without its perks, among them control of the building&#x2019;s security system, and he manages to sneak out and return, unscathed and unnoticed. His curiosity soon leads him to dark rabbit holes, though, and Ben begins to suspect his father of illicit dealings with strange characters.</p>
