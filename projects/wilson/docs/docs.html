!header Wilson Documentation

!text b j An explanation of Wilson&#x2019;s properties and methods. At the time of writing, private variables are barely implemented in JavaScript, so although all variables are public, only the ones listed here are intended to be.




<div style="height: 15vh"></div>

!text h Constructor

<div style="height: 5vh"></div>

!text b j <code>constructor(canvas, options)</code>: <code>canvas</code> is an existing canvas element and <code>options</code> is an object specifying settings for Wilson to use. The full list of recognized options is as follows:

<br>
<br>

!text b j <code>render</code>: determines the type of canvas and the method used to render it. Valid values are <code>"cpu"</code>, <code>"hybrid"</code> (default), or <code>"gpu"</code>. <code>"cpu"</code> uses a standard canvas and draws frames by modifying its image data. <code>"hybrid"</code> uses a WebGL canvas and draws frames by rendering them as textures. This mode can increase the maximum canvas size in some browsers and should generally be used over <code>"cpu"</code>. Finally, <code>"gpu"</code> uses a WebGL canvas and renders a fragment shader that&#x2019;s also passed in the options.

!text b j <code>shader</code>: a fragment shader for a WebGL canvas. Ignored unless <code>render</code> is <code>"gpu"</code>.

!text b j <code>world_width, world_height</code>: the width and height of the space (i.e. "world") the canvas is representing. For use with interpolation functions and callbacks. Default to <code>2</code> to match WebGL.

!text b j <code>world_center_x, world_center_y</code>: the coordinates that the center pixel of the canvas represents, similarly to <code>world_width</code> and <code>world_height</code>. Default to <code>0</code>.

!text b j <code>auto_arrange_canvases</code>: a boolean indicating whether to the canvas into the container structure necessary to use draggables and fullscreen. Defaults to <code>true</code>, and strongly recommended to stay that way unless you know what you&#x2019;re doing.

<br>
<br>

!text b j <code>use_draggables</code>: a boolean indicating whether to add the necessary elements to use draggables. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

!text b j <code>draggables_*_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when an event of type <code>*</code> is fired on a draggable that is currently being held. The callback syntax is <code>f(index, x, y, event)</code>, where <code>index</code> is the index of the targeted draggable, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are its world coordinates, and <code>event</code> is the fired event. Valid values for <code>*</code> are <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, <code>mouseup</code>, <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code>, and <code>touchend</code>.

<br>
<br>

!text b j <code>use_fullscreen</code>: a boolean indicating whether to add the necessary elements to use fullscreen. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

!text b j <code>true_fullscreen</code>: a boolean indicating whether to stretch the canvas in fullscreen to fit the window. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

!text b j <code>canvases_to_resize</code>: an array of canvases or other elements that need to be resized when entering or exiting fullscreen. The canvas passed in the constructor is automatically, as is the draggables container.

!text b j <code>use_fullscreen_button</code>: a boolean indicating whether to add a button in the top-right corner of the canvas to enter and exit fullscreen. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

!text b j <code>enter_fullscreen_button_icon_path</code>: a string giving the path to the image to be used for the button to enter fullscreen. Required if <code>use_fullscreen_button</code> is <code>true</code> and ignored otherwise.

!text b j <code>exit_fullscreen_button_icon_path</code>: a string giving the path to the image to be used for the button to exit fullscreen. Required if <code>use_fullscreen_button</code> is <code>true</code> and ignored otherwise.

!text b j <code>switch_fullscreen_callback</code>: a function to be called when fullscreen is entered or exited. Typically used to change the canvas and/or world size. Not passed any parameters.

<br>
<br>

!text b j <code>mousedown_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>mousedown</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>mousemove_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>mousemove</code> event is fired on the canvas and the mouse is <strong>not</strong> being held. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, x_delta, y_delta, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location, <code>x_delta</code> and <code>y_delta</code> are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>mousedrag_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>mousemove</code> event is fired on the canvas and the mouse <strong>is</strong> being held. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, x_delta, y_delta, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location, <code>x_delta</code> and <code>y_delta</code> are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>mouseup_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>mouseup</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>touchstart_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>touchstart</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>touchmove_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>touchmove</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, x_delta, y_delta, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location, <code>x_delta</code> and <code>y_delta</code> are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>touchend_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>touchend</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>wheel_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a <code>wheel</code> event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, scroll_amount, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location, <code>scroll_amount</code> is the reported scroll delta amount (which can vary wildly between browers), and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.

!text b j <code>pinch_callback</code>: a function <code>f</code> to be called when a two-finger pinch gesture occurs on the canvas. The callback syntax is <code>f(x, y, touch_distance_delta, event)</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the world coordinates of the event location, <code>touch_distance_delta</code> is the world distance between the two touch points on this event minus that distance on the last event, and <code>event</code> is the fired event itself.
