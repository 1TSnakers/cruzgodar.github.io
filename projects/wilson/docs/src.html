An explanation of Wilson's properties and methods. At the time of writing, private variables are barely implemented in JavaScript, so although all variables are public, only the ones listed here are intended to be.



## Constructor

`new Wilson(canvas, options)`: `canvas` is an existing canvas element and `options` is an object specifying settings for Wilson to use. The full list of recognized options is as follows:



`render`: determines the type of canvas and the method used to render it. Valid values are `"cpu"`, `"hybrid"` (default), or `"gpu"`. `"cpu"` uses a standard canvas and draws frames by modifying its image data. `"hybrid"` uses a WebGL canvas and draws frames by rendering them as textures. This mode can increase the maximum canvas size in some browsers and should generally be used over `"cpu"`. Finally, `"gpu"` uses a WebGL canvas and renders a fragment shader that's also passed in the options.

`shader`: a fragment shader for a WebGL canvas. Ignored unless `render` is `"gpu"`.

`canvasWidth, canvasHeight`: the width and height of the canvas in pixels. Can be left undefined, but if so, the canvas element needs to have its width and height properties defined.

`worldWidth, worldHeight`: the width and height of the space (i.e. "world") the canvas is representing. For use with interpolation functions and callbacks. Default to `2` to match WebGL.

`worldCenterX, worldCenterY`: the coordinates that the center pixel of the canvas represents, similarly to `worldWidth` and `worldHeight`. Default to `0`.

`autoArrangeCanvases`: a boolean indicating whether to the canvas into the container structure necessary to use draggables and fullscreen. Defaults to `true`, and strongly recommended to stay that way unless you know what you're doing.



`useDraggables`: a boolean indicating whether to add the necessary elements to use draggables. Defaults to `false`.

`draggables_*Callback`: a function `f` to be called when an event of type `*` is fired on a draggable that is currently being held. The callback syntax is `f(index, x, y, event)`, where `index` is the index of the targeted draggable, `x` and `y` are its world coordinates, and `event` is the fired event. Valid values for `*` are `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend`.



`useFullscreen`: a boolean indicating whether to add the necessary elements to use fullscreen. Defaults to `false`.

`trueFullscreen`: a boolean indicating whether to stretch the canvas in fullscreen to fit the window. Defaults to `false`.

`canvasesToResize`: an array of canvases or other elements that need to be resized when entering or exiting fullscreen. The canvas passed in the constructor is automatically, as is the draggables container.

`useFullscreenButton`: a boolean indicating whether to add a button in the top-right corner of the canvas to enter and exit fullscreen. Defaults to `false`.

`enterFullscreenButtonIconPath`: a string giving the path to the image to be used for the button to enter fullscreen. Required if `useFullscreenButton` is `true` and ignored otherwise.

`exitFullscreenButtonIconPath`: a string giving the path to the image to be used for the button to exit fullscreen. Required if `useFullscreenButton` is `true` and ignored otherwise.

`switchFullscreenCallback`: a function to be called when fullscreen is entered or exited. Typically used to change the canvas and/or world size. Not passed any parameters.



`mousedownCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `mousedown` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location and `event` is the fired event itself.

`mousemoveCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `mousemove` event is fired on the canvas and the mouse is *not* being held. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, xDelta, yDelta, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location, `xDelta` and `yDelta` are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and `event` is the fired event itself.

`mousedragCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `mousemove` event is fired on the canvas and the mouse *is* being held. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, xDelta, yDelta, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location, `xDelta` and `yDelta` are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and `event` is the fired event itself.

`mouseupCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `mouseup` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location and `event` is the fired event itself.

`touchstartCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `touchstart` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location and `event` is the fired event itself.

`touchmoveCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `touchmove` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, xDelta, yDelta, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location, `xDelta` and `yDelta` are the differences in world coordinates from the last event, and `event` is the fired event itself.

`touchendCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `touchend` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location and `event` is the fired event itself.

`wheelCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a `wheel` event is fired on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, scrollAmount, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location, `scrollAmount` is the reported scroll delta amount (which can vary wildly between browers), and `event` is the fired event itself.

`pinchCallback`: a function `f` to be called when a two-finger pinch gesture occurs on the canvas. The callback syntax is `f(x, y, touchDistanceDelta, event)`, where `x` and `y` are the world coordinates of the event location, `touchDistanceDelta` is the world distance between the two touch points on this event minus that distance on the last event, and `event` is the fired event itself.



## General

`wilson.canvas`: the canvas element passed in the constructor.

`wilson.ctx`: the 2d canvas context. Only usable if `options.render` is `"cpu"`.

`wilson.gl`: the WebGL context. Only usable if `options.render` is `"hybrid"` or `"gpu"`.

`wilson.uniforms`: a dictionary with all WebGL uniform locations. Only usable if `options.render` is `"gpu"` and after calling `wilson.render.initUniforms()`.

`wilson.worldWidth`, `wilson.worldHeight`: the width and height of the space (i.e. "world") the canvas is representing. For use with interpolation functions and callbacks.

`wilson.worldCenterX`, `wilson.worldCenterY`: the coordinates that the center pixel of the canvas represents, similarly to `worldWidth` and `worldHeight`.

`wilson.changeCanvasSize(width, height)`: changes the canvas size and adjusts the gl viewport if needed. If changing the border or padding of a canvas, this should be called to recalculate the size of the draggable container and other internal values.

`wilson.downloadFrame(filename)`: downloads the current state of the canvas as a png with the specified filename.



## Utility Functions

`wilson.utils.interpolate.canvasToWorld(x, y)`: returns a 2-element array `[row, col]` of canvas coordinates corresponding to the world coordinates given.

`wilson.utils.interpolate.worldToCanvas(x, y)`: returns a 2-element array `[x, y]` of world coordinates corresponding to the canvas coordinates given.

`wilson.utils.hsvToRgb(h, s, v)`: converts an HSV representation of a color to the equivalent RGB representation. Accepts `h`, `s`, `v` between 0 and 1 and returns a 3-element array `[r, g, b]` between 0 and 255, unrounded.



## Rendering

`wilson.render.drawFrame(imageData)`: draws a frame to the canvas. `imageData` is a `Uint8ClampedArray` of length `canvasWidth * canvasHeight * 4`, where each sequence of 4 elements gives an RGBA representation of a pixel. If `options.render` is `"gpu"`, `imageData` is ignored.

`wilson.render.initUniforms(uniformNames)`: stores the uniform locations for a shader in `wilson.uniformLocations`. `uniformNames` is an array of strings giving the names of the uniforms in the shader. Only to be used if `options.render` is `"gpu"`.

`wilson.render.getPixelData`: returns a `Uint8Array` of length `canvasWidth * canvasHeight * 4`, where each sequence of 4 elements gives an RGBA representation of a pixel. Only to be used if `options.render` is `"gpu"`.



## Draggables

`wilson.draggables.worldCoordinates`: a list of the world coordinates of each draggable.

`wilson.draggables.numDraggables`: the number of draggables that have been added to the canvas.

`wilson.draggables.draggableRadius`: the radius, including border and padding, of the draggable. Needs to be updated if the style is changed.

`wilson.draggables.add(x, y)`: adds a new draggable at the specified world coordinates.

`wilson.draggables.recalculateLocations()`: recalculates all of the draggables' page coordinates based on their world coordinates.



## Fullscreen

`wilson.fullscreen.currentlyFullscreen`: a boolean indicating whether the canvas is currently fullscreen.

`wilson.fullscreen.switchFullscreen()`: toggles fullscreen and windowed mode. To be used when not using the built-in fullscreen button.



## Interactivity

`wilson.input.getZoomedWorldCenter(fixedPointX, fixedPointY, newWorldWidth, newWorldHeight)`: gets the world center that will make the given point a fixed point of a zoom. To be called *before* changing the world width and height, and passed the values they will be changed to.
